<p>(See below for important information for anyone following my SVN
repository)</p>
<p>I've decided to replace SLV2 with a new library (named "Lilv") instead
of breaking the API which has been causing a lot of hassle, and would
only cause more when it gets released and packaged. Among other things,
this gives me the opportunity to rework the installation to support
parallel installs of different major versions to prevent this kind of
problem in the future. It also gives me a chance to improve the API and
remove some cruft that has accumulated to avoid breaking the API (SLV2
has been around for many years now, and LV2 (and myself) have come a
long way since then, it's a good time to do some laundry).</p>
<p>Anyone who has an SVN version of SLV2 installed, please uninstall it
immediately and pretend it never existed. SLV2 0.6.6 is the last version
of SLV2. The first Lilv release will be out shortly.</p>
