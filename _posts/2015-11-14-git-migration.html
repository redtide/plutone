<p>I have finally migrated all of my software to git. This was not a very
fun process due to the nested nature of my "drobillad" repository, but
now all projects live in their own git repositories with history and
tags from SVN preserved.</p>
<p>It is still possible to build all my audio software in one step, the
top-level repository <a href="http://git.drobilla.net/drobillad.git">http://git.drobilla.net/drobillad.git</a> is now a
skeleton with git submodules for each project. Anyone using SVN should
switch immediately, the SVN repositories will remain in their current
state for the foreseeable future but all development activity will move
to git.</p>
<p>All the repositories are available in <a href="http://git.drobilla.net/">cgit</a>,
but changes and tickets and so on are in
<a href="http://dev.drobilla.net/">Trac</a> as always. Happy hacking.</p>
