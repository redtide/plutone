<p>Weâ€™ve published a <a href="/tutorials/brush_stirs">new tutorial</a> explaining how to use samples to
model brushed drum techniques which produce a continuous sound
rather than a discrete hit. Admittedly, this is a rather niche technique not only
in the samples world but also in real-world music, mainly used in
jazz and some indie music. Next we plan to expand the <a href="/tutorials/vibrato">vibrato tutorial</a>,
which is currently only a simple code example.</p>

<p>Minor updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>global_label, master_label, group_label and region_label opcodes added.</li>
  <li>Added Carla and Bliss Sampler to SFZ players, updated TAL Sampler info.</li>
</ul>
