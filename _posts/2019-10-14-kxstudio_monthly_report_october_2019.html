<p>
    Hello all, today is October 15th, a Linux/Libre-Audio release day.<br/>
    I do not have anything to actually release (that is ready anyway), so I thought to instead start something new.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Every month, starting with this one, we will have a monthly report regarding the latest stuff in KXStudio.<br/>
    This will involve new releases, package updates to its repositories, important bug-fixes and short-term plans.<br/>
    So let's begin...
</p>
<p>
    First of all, in case you somehow missed it,
    <a href="https://kx.studio/News/?action=view&amp;url=jack2-v1913-release">
        a new JACK2 release is here</a>!<br/>
    This finally brings meta-data support into JACK2. More information about meta-data in JACK can be found
    <a href="https://jackaudio.org/metadata/" target="_blank">
        here</a>.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    On the repositories, "helm" package had an issue where the plugin could not find its own presets.<br/>
    (This was caused due to KXStudio repositories going ahead on renaming "helm" to "Helm" as the former already exists)<br/>
    <br style="line-height:0.5em"/>
    ZynAddSubFX got (re-)added, using its nice and fancy Zyn-Fusion UI.<br/>
    In the old repositories there was "zynaddsubfx" for old UI, and "zynaddsubfx-git" for the new one.<br/>
    The "git" package is gone, only "zynaddsubfx" is there now and it has the new UI. +1 for progress!<br/>
    <br style="line-height:0.5em"/>
    x42-plugins got updated to 20191013 release.<br/>
    <br style="line-height:0.5em"/>
    Fluajho, Patroneo and Vico were added. (nice simple tools from Nils Hilbricht)<br/>
    These last ones were tricky since they use python libraries.<br/>
    In order to make it a generic package I resorted to cxfreeze which makes it run independent of the system python.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Coming soon is Carla 2.1-beta1.<br/>
    The actual software is ready for the beta1 release, but setting up the infrastructure for an updated Qt5 build is taking longer than expected.<br/>
    The current 2.0 builds use quite an old Qt version: Qt5.5 on macOS, Qt4(!) on Linux, which I do not accept for new releases going forward.<br/>
    Windows builds are ready to go though, you can find test binaries on Carla's
    <a href="https://github.com/falkTX/Carla/releases">
        github</a>.<br/>
    Once I finish setting up the builds for Linux and macOS, I will make the announcement. Very likely in mid-November.
</p>
<p>
    Finally,
    <a href="https://www.sonoj.org/" target="_blank">
        Sonoj
    </a>
    is coming!<br/>
    Sonoj is an annual event/convention in Cologne, Germany, about music production with free and open source software.<br/>
    It features demonstrations, talks and hands-on workshops.<br/>
    You can meet like-minded people, learn insider knowledge and tricks, participate in their one-hour production challenge!<br/>
    It is only a few days from now, so please get ready! :)<br/>
    I will be doing a talk in Sonoj about the past, present and future of JACK.<br/>
    So please come and say hi, registration is free!<br/>
