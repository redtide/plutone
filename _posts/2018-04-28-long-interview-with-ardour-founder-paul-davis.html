Ardour founder Paul Davis sat down recently with Darwin Grosse of Cycling 74 (Max) to talk about the program, his own personal history, audio technology, software platforms and a whole lot more besides. It's roughly an hour long, and Paul reports that he was unusually satisfied with what he managed to say during this chat.

You can find it at Darwin's Art &amp; Music &amp; Technology podcast: https://artmusictech.libsyn.com/podcast-214-paul-davis-ardour

Quite possibly worth taking a listen to Darwin's chat with Andrew Belt of VCVRack too ... full list of episodes here: https://artmusictech.libsyn.com/
