              <p>It’s been a productive 3 weeks since we tagged the current code as “6.0-pre1”. Roughly 400 or so commits (changes) later, we’re now marking the current code as “6.0-rc1”, which means:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>no more translatable string changes before release (i.e. no major user-visible changes). Translators can now finish their work with high confidence that if they complete a translation, there will be no need to revisit it before 6.0 is released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No substantial changes between now and the release of 6.0</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We welcome bug reports and feature requests on <a href="http://tracker.ardour.org">tracker.ardour.org</a> as always.</p>
<p>Two notable “newish” features that have landed since pre1 are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ardour now supports web interfaces via a websocket and JSON protocol. Luciano Iam was responsible for this work, and has already added a couple of demo “web pages” to show browser control of Ardour. We imagine/hope that this new “control surface” support will expand significantly during the post-6.0 development process. Start Ardour, enable websocket surface support, and point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3818/">http://localhost:3818/</a> … then get busy with some HTML/CSS/JS. It must be stressed that this all preliminary work, and is not considered “finished”. However, it is open for significant contributions by non-C++ developers now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MIDI editing keybindings (shift notes in time and pitch, change velocities etc. etc.) are now all user-definable rather than hard-coded. The key editor now provides a handy reference for keyboard shortcuts when editing MIDI notes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
