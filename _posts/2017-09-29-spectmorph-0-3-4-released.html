<p>A new version of SpectMorph, my audio morphing software is now available on <a href="http://www.spectmorph.org">www.spectmorph.org</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest addition is an ADSR-Envelope which is optional, but when enabled allows overriding the natural instruments attack and volume envelope (<a href="http://spectmorph.org/news.php">full list of changes</a>).</p>
<p>I also created a <a href="http://spectmorph.org/screencasts.php">screencast of SpectMorph</a> which gives a quick overview of the possibilities.</p>
