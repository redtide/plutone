<p><a href="http://download.drobilla.net/raul-0.7.0.tar.bz2">raul 0.7.0</a> has been released.  Raul (Realtime Audio Utility Library) is a lightweight C++ convenience library for realtime programming, with a bias towards audio applications. For more information, see <a href="http://drobilla.net/software/raul">http://drobilla.net/software/raul</a>.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add several unit tests</li>
<li>Use malloc'd memory for RingBuffer/SRSWQueue (instead of a new'd array)</li>
<li>Fancy coloured console/logging I/O (raul/log.hpp)</li>
<li>More flexible Path and better URI support</li>
<li>Atom updates, including new "Blank" Atom for storing dictionaries with URI keys (ala JavaScript "objects", but RDF compatible)</li>
<li>Remove stack stuff from Array and create new ArrayStack</li>
<li>Make Symbol and URI more opaque and use Glib string interning</li>
<li>Add Configuration class for app command line option handling</li>
<li>Use &lt; operator in TableImpl instead of &gt; so it needn't be defined</li>
<li>Add IntrusivePtr, a trivial #define of boost::intrusive_ptr which is useful for hard realtime things (since adding and dropping refs is realtime safe, which is not true of shared_ptr)</li>
<li>Remove TimeSlice</li>
</ul>
