<ul>
  <li>Added a VST3 plug-in front-end to the library. It is still quite experimental
and suffers from problems that stem from the VST3 SDK itself. (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/pull/99">#99</a>)</li>
  <li>Added effect buses and processing. There is a <a href="https://sfzformat.com/opcodes/type#lofi">lofi</a> effect available for now,
as well as the same filters and EQs you can apply on the regions.
More will come soon! (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/pull/84">#84</a>)</li>
  <li>Added a script to parse and render the timings.
This can help tracking performance issues and regressions. (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/pull/89">#89</a>)</li>
  <li>Various fixups, performance improvements, and CI updates.</li>
</ul>
