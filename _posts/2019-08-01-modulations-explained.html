<p>We have two new articles explaining the modulations possible in <a href="/tutorials/sfz1_modulations">SFZ1</a>
and <a href="/tutorials/sfz2_modulations">SFZ2</a>. Hopefully it will now be much easier to understand
what’s possible under each spec level, and just what those complex SFZ2 LFOs and envelopes can
and can’t do.</p>
