<p>I have released my new stack of libraries for implementing LV2 in hosts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/serd">Serd</a>, a fast, lightweight,
   dependency-free Turtle syntax library</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/sord">Sord</a>, an in-memory RDF quad
   store</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/lilv">Lilv</a>, an LV2 host library
   (replaces SLV2)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/suil">Suil</a>, an LV2 UI
   loading/embedding library</li>
</ul>
<p>These libraries collectively replace SLV2, and have no dependencies
except amongst themselves, and Glib (by Lilv and Sord, but this
dependency will likely be removed in the near future). Serd and Sord
replace Redland, making for a dramatically smaller implementation more
appropriate for audio software and embedded applications.</p>
<p>Overall, Lilv is dramatically faster and leaner than SLV2, enough that
the improvement should be quite noticeable from a user point of view
(typically in a lag when the host first loads all LV2 data). Anyone
using SLV2 is highly encouraged to migrate to Lilv.</p>
<p>These libraries are well tested, each (except Suil) with a test suite
covering over 90% of the code, which runs without memory errors or
leaks. They are new, however, so (as always) there may be problems;
<a href="http://dev.drobilla.net/newticket">feedback</a> is most welcome.</p>
