              <p>
  Ardour 5.9 is now available, representing several months of
  development that spans some new features and many improvements
  and fixes.
</p>
<p>
  Among other things, some significant optimizations were made
  to redraw performance on OS X/macOS that may be apparent if
  you are using Ardour on that platform. There were further
  improvements to tempo and MIDI related features and lots of
  small improvements to state serialization. Support for the
  Presonus Faderport 8 control surface was added (see the manual
  for some quite
  thorough <a href="http://manual.ardour.org/using-control-surfaces/PreSonus_FaderPort8/">documentation).
</a></p>
<p>
  As usual, there are also dozens or hundreds of other fixes
  based on continuing feedback from wonderful Ardour users
  worldwide.
