<p>I have been working on getting accurate transport information provided
to <a href="http://lv2plug.in/">LV2</a> plugins. Until now, there was the ability
to specially designate e.g. BPM control ports, but this has limitations,
the most obvious being that it is is limited to conveying simple numeric
values at the start of a cycle.</p>
<p>In general, things are headed in an event-based direction, and this is
no exception. The <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/time">LV2 Time</a> extension
defines all the properties needed to describe a transport
position/speed/tempo/meter and the <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/atom">LV2
Atom</a> extension defines a dictionary type
that can be used to send several properties at once in a single event.
The host sends updates whenever the transport has changed in a way the
plugin can not anticipate (anything but rolling along at the same
speed/tempo/meter). Since events are time stamped, this makes it
possible to give plugins a sample accurate tempo map, even when there
are changes in the middle of a cycle.</p>
<p>There is a new example plugin in the LV2 repository, eg-metro, which is
a simple metronome that follows this scheme. If the host implements the
above, the metronome will click in sync with the host transport.</p>
<p>I have implemented this in <a href="http://drobilla.net/software/jalv">Jalv</a>
(which uses Jack transport), <a href="http://ardour.org">Ardour</a> 3, and
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/ingen">Ingen</a> (via a new internal "Time"
block). Ardour will send an update at the start of the cycle if a
relocate has happened, and one on the exact sample of any meter or tempo
change within the cycle. Due to the limitations of Jack transport, Jalv
and Ingen will only send updates at the start of a cycle. The metronome
should tick correctly when loaded in Jalv or Ingen when there is a Jack
transport master active (I have tested with Ardour), and when loaded
directly in Ardour.</p>
<p>This functionality is pretty important for many musical plugins, so
hopefully other host authors implement it as well. Depending on feedback
(and available time) I may document the above rules as a feature and add
it to the time extension, and release LV2 1.2.2. I think a well-defined
way to achieve this is worthy of a point release, and it will get the
news out there to implementers.</p>
