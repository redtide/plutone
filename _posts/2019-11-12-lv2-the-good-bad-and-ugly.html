<p>It occurred to me that I haven't really been documenting what I've been up to,
a lot of which is behind the scenes in non-release branches, so I thought I
would write a post about the general action around LV2 lately.  I've also been
asked several times about what the long-term strategy for LV2 is, if there
should be an "LV3", whether LV* can start to really gain traction as a
competitor to the big proprietary formats, and so on.</p>
<p>So, here it is, a huge brain dump on what's good, what's bad, what's ugly, and
what I think should be done about it.</p>
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>LV2 is different from other plugin standards in several ways.  This is not
always a good thing (which we'll get to shortly), but there are some things
that have proven to be very good ideas, even if the execution was not always
ideal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Openness: Obvious, but worth mentioning anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensibility: The general idea of building an extensible core, so that
   plugin and host authors can add functionality in a controlled way is a great
   one.  This allows developers to prototype new functionality to eventually be
   standardised, make use of additional functionality if it is available, and
   so on.  Some problems, like ensuring things are documented, that
   implementations agree, and so on, get more difficult when anybody can add
   anything, but this is worth the benefit of not having a standardisation
   process block getting things done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DSP and UI split: Also obvious in my opinion, but certainly not a universal
   thing.  There are a lot of bad things to be said about the actual state of
   GUI support, but keeping them separate, with the <em>option</em> to have a pointer
   to the guts of a plugin instance is the right approach.  Having a
   well-defined way to communicate between GUI and DSP makes it easy to do the
   right thing.  Multi-threaded realtime programming is hard, and plugins
   dropping out because of GUI activity and so on should not be a thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard implementation between host and plugins (for some things): This is
   a huge win in reducing the burden on both host and plugin authors, and
   allows both to rely on certain things being done right.  This also makes a
   location where stronger validation and so on can happen, which we should
   exploit more.  The war between host and plugin authors, trying to make
   things compatible with the arbitrary behaviour of countless implementations
   is largely why everyone hates plugins.  This doesn't have to be a thing.  We
   haven't actually done well in that area with LV2 (quite the opposite), but
   having a place to put that code is the right move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparent communication: Though you technically can do just about anything
   with LV2, a "proper" plugin has a transparent control interface that works
   in a standard way.  This gets you all kinds of things for free, like
   human-readable debug tracing, network transparency, and so on, and also
   encourages design that's better from a user point of view, like having good
   host controls for parameters, automation, accessibility, and so on.  This is
   somewhat related to having a DSP and UI split.  The benefits of having
   plugins be controlled in a standard way are endless, as are the awful things
   that happen when GUIs and audio code aren't forcefully kept at arm's reach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<p>Now to the more interesting part.  There are some nice ideas in LV2, and I
think an idealised and cleaned up version of it that adheres to the main
underlying design principles would be beautiful.  In reality, however, LV2 is
an atrocious mess in all kinds of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Control ports: LV2 uses LADSPA-style control ports, which contain a single
   float.  This is a tricky one to put in the "bad" category, since
   pragmatically grafting extensibility onto LADSPA is why LV2 has been
   moderately successful.  It had to be that way: we needed working plugins,
   not a tedious standardisation process that goes nowhere (there's already
   GMPI for that).  That said, control ports are incredibly limiting and that
   they still exist is an endless source of trouble: they are static, they
   require buffer splitting for sample accuracy, they can only convey a float,
   there is no hook to detect changes and do smoothing, and so on. A control
   protocol (something like MIDI except... good) is the right way to control
   plugins.  Notes and controls and all the rest should be in the same stream,
   synchronous with audio.  It's hard to migrate to such a reality, but there
   should be one consistent way to control a plugin, and it should be a stream
   of sample-accurate events.  No methods, no threading and ABI nightmares, no
   ambiguity, just a nice synchronous stream of inputs, and a single run
   function that reads those and produces outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>connect_port</code> method: Another LADSPA-ism.  This means that using some
   signal means the host must call a method on the plugin to connect it first.
   This is an awful design: it forces both the host and the plugin to maintain
   more state than is necessary, and it's slow.  I have written several plugins
   that would be completely stateless (essentially pure functions) except the
   spec requires the plugin to maintain all these pointers and implement
   methods to mutate them.  Inputs and outputs just should be passed to the run
   method, so all of that goes away and everything is nicely scoped.  As far as
   the basics of the C API are concerned, this is, in my opinion, the most
   egregious mistake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turtle: Everyone loves to hate Turtle.  It's mostly a nice syntax (if the
   namespace prefix limitations are very annoying), but it's weird.  Worse,
   people might search for "RDF" and find the confusing W3C trash-fire there.
   The underlying ideas are good, but that three-letter-acronym should be
   absolutely eliminated from the spec and documentation.  The good thing in
   LV2 is really just "property-centric design", which can be explained in a
   simple way anyone can understand.  It's more or less just "JSON with URIs"
   anyway, and nobody ever got fired for using JSON.  Speaking of which,
   syntax-wise, JSON-LD is probably the way to go today.  JSON is annoying in
   different ways, but this would allow LV2 data files to look completely
   typical to almost any developer, but still have the same meaning and have
   the same advantages under the hood of a real data model.  This could
   actually be done without breaking anything in practice, but JSON-LD is much
   harder to implement so I'm not quite there yet.  It would also be some work
   to write the vocabulary (vocabularies?), but it's doable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of quality control: Again a consequence of pragmatic evolution, but the
   lack of standard quality control has become a real problem.  There has been
   progress made there, with things like <code>lv2lint</code> and <code>lv2_validate</code>, but it's
   not good enough.  The biggest problem with plugins (and plugin hosts) in
   general is that most of them are just broken.  There should be a standard
   test suite for both, that is as strict as possible, and its use should be
   strongly "encouraged" at the very least.  The above-mentioned existence of
   standard code in-between hosts and plugins could be useful here, for
   example, hosts could just refuse to load non-conforming plugins outright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extension spam: The "standard" extensions are not all very good, or widely
   supported.  They also aren't broken down and organized especially well in
   some cases.  We are at least somewhat stuck with this for compatibility, but
   it makes things confusing.  There are many reasons for this, but in general
   I think a better thought-out standardisation process, and a "sort of
   standard" staging ground to put contributions that some implementations
   agree on but aren't ideal or quite at "recommended standard" yet would help.
   I'm still not sure exactly how to do this, there's no best practice for such
   things out there that's easy to steal, but with the benefit of hindsight I
   think we could do much better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Library spam: The standard host implementation is quite a few libraries.
   This is a mostly good thing, in that they have distinct purposes, different
   dependencies, and so on, but in practice it's annoying for packagers, or
   anyone who wants to vendor it.  I think the best approach here is to combine
   them into a meta-package or "SDK", so libraries can still be properly split
   but without the maintenance burden.  I am working towards this with
   "lv2kit".  It's currently hard for outsiders to even figure out what they
   need, a one-stop "all the LV2 things" in a single package would help
   immensely, especially for people outside of the Linux world (where
   distributions package everything anyway, so nobody really cares).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C++ and other language bindings: Plugin interfaces more or less have to be
   in C.  However, outside of POSIXland, nobody wants to actually write C.
   Virtually the entire audio industry uses C++.  Good bindings are important.
   Python is also nice for some things.  Rust would be great, and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Ugly</h3>
<p>These are things that are just... well, ugly.  Not really "bad" in concrete ways
that matter much, but make life unpleasant all the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extensibility only through the URI-based mechanism: In general,
   extensibility is good.  The host can pass whatever features, and plugins can
   publish whatever interfaces, and everything is discoverable and degrades
   gracefully and so on.  It works.  The downside is that there's some
   syntactic overhead to that which can be annoying.  We should have put sizes
   or versions in structs so they were also extensible in the classical way.
   For example, the <code>connect_port</code> problem mentioned above could be fixed by
   adding a new run method, but we can't literally add a new run method to
   <code>LV2_Descriptor</code>.  We would have to make a separate interface, and have the
   host access it with <code>extension_data</code>, and so on, which makes things ugly.
   Maybe this is for the best, but ugliness matters.  In general there are a
   few places where we could have used more typical C patterns.  Weirdness
   matters too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extension organization: The list of specifications is a complete mess.  It
   annoys me so much.  I am not really sure about this: in some cases, an
   extension is a clearly separate thing, and having it be essentially a
   separate spec is great.  In other cases, we've ended up with vaguely related
   grab-bags of things for lack of anywhere else to put them.  I sometimes
   wonder if the KISS approach of just having one big namespace would have been
   the right way to go.  It would mean less prefixes everywhere at the very
   least.  Maybe we could use some other way of grouping things where it makes
   sense?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static data: This is a tough one.  One of the design principles of LV2 is
   that hosts don't need to load and run any code to just discover plugins, and
   information about them.  This is <em>great</em>.  However, whenever the need for
   something more dynamic comes along (dynamic ports, say), we don't have any
   great way to deal with it, because the way everything is described is
   inherently static.  Going fully dynamic doesn't feel great either.  I think
   the solution here is to take advantage of the fact that the data files are
   really just a syntax and the same data can be expressed in other ways. We
   already have all the fundamental bits here, Atoms are essentially
   "realtime-ready RDF" and can be round-tripped to Turtle without loss.  My
   grand, if vague, vision here is that everything could just be the same
   conceptually, and the source of it be made irrelevant and hidden behind a
   single API. For example, a data file can say things like (pseudocode alert)
   <code>&lt;volume&gt; hasType Float; &lt;volume&gt; minimumValue 0.0; &lt;volume&gt; maximumValue
   1.0</code> but a message from a plugin can say exactly the same thing at run time.
   If the host library (lilv) handled all this nicely, hosts could just do
   <code>lv2_get_minimum(gain)</code> and not really care where the information came from.
   I think this is a much better approach than grafting on ever-more API for
   every little thing, but it would have to be done nicely with good support.
   I think the key here is to retain the advantages we have, but put some work
   into making really obvious and straightforward APIs for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overly dynamic URIDs: URIDs are a mechanism in LV2 where things are
   conceptually URIs (which makes everything extensible), but integers in
   practice for speed.  Generally a URID is made at instantiation time by
   calling a host-provided mapping function.  This is, for the most part,
   wonderful, but being always dynamic causes some problems.  You need dynamic
   state to talk about URIs at all, which makes for a lot of boilerplate, and
   gets in the way of things like language bindings (you couldn't make a simple
   standalone template that gives you an <code>Int</code> atom for an <code>int32_t</code>, for
   example).  I think it would be a good idea to have a static set of URIDs for
   things in the standard, so that <code>lv2_minimum</code> or whatever is just statically
   there, but preserve the ability to extend things with dynamic mapping.  This
   is easy enough by adding the concept of a "minimum dynamic URID value",
   where everything less than that is reserved by the standard.  Alternatively,
   or perhaps in addition, maybe having a standard loader to ease the pain of
   loading every little thing (like with OpenGL) would help make code cleaner
   and boilerplate free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Documentation Sucks: Of course, the documentation of everything always
   sucks, so you have to take this feedback with a grain of salt, but it's true
   of LV2.  A lot of improvements here are blocked by the specification
   breakdown being set in stone, but it could be improved.  I think the
   reference documentation is not the problem though, we really need
   example-driven documentation written as prose.  This is a completely
   different thing to reference documentation and I think it's important to not
   confuse the two.  There has been a bit of work adapting the "book" to be
   better in this sense, but it's not very far along.  Once it's there, it
   needs to be brought to the forefront, and the reference documentation put in
   a place where it's clear it's about details.  Optics matter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>I'm sure there are countless things floating around in my mind I've forgotten
about at the moment, but that's all that comes to mind at a high level.  There
are, of course, countless little specific problems that need work (like
inventing a control protocol for everything, and having it be powerful but
pleasant to use), but I'm only focusing on the greater things about LV2 itself,
as a specification family and a project.  The big question, of course, is
whether LV3 should be a thing.  I am not sure, it's a hard question.  My
thinking is: maybe, but we should work towards it first.  It's always tempting
to throw out everything and Do It Right, but that never works out.  The
extensible nature of LV2 means that we can graft better things on over time,
until all the various pieces feel right.  I see no point in breaking the entire
world with a grandiose LV3 project until, for example, we've figured out how we
want to control plugins.  I am a big believer in iterative design, and working
code in general.  We can build that in LV2.  Maybe we can even do it and end up
at more or less LV3 anyway, without causing any hard breakage.  To that end, I
have been improving things in general, to try and address some of the above,
and generally bring the software up to a level of quality I am happy with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Portability: The LV2 host stack has (almost) always been at least
   theoretically portable, and relatively portable in practice, but it's
   obvious that it comes from the Linux world and <em>might</em> work elsewhere.  I
   have been doing a lot of work on the DevOps front to ensure that everything
   works everywhere, always, and no platform is second-class.  The libraries
   live on Gitlab, and have a CI setup that builds and tests on Linux (both x86
   and ARM), Windows, and MacOS, and cross-compiles with MinGW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequent releases: Another consequence of the many-libraries problem is that
   releasing is <em>really</em> tedious, and I'm generally pretty bad at making
   releases.  This makes things just feel stale.  I've recently almost entirely
   automated this process, so that <em>everything</em> involved in making a release
   can be done by just calling a script.  Also on the DevOps and stale fronts,
   I've been moving to automatically generating documentation on CI, so it's
   always published and up to date.  Automating everything is important to keep
   a project vibrant, especially when maintenance resources are scarce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally complex APIs: The library APIs aren't great, and the general
   situation is confusing.  Most authors only need Lilv, but there are these
   "Serd" and "Sord" things in there that show up sometimes, all work with
   roughly the same sort of "nodes", but all have different types and APIs for
   them, and so on.  I have been working on a new major version of serd that
   takes advantage of the API break to make things much simpler, and improve
   all kinds of things in general.  This will be exposed directly in lilv where
   it makes sense, eliminating a lot of glue, and eliminating the sord library
   entirely.  The lilv API itself is also dramatically bigger and more
   complicated than it needs to be.  At the time, it felt like adding obvious
   helper methods for every little thing was a good idea, so people can just
   find <code>lv2_port_get_specific_thing_I_want()</code> which is nice when it's
   there... except it's not always there.  The property-based design of LV2
   means that <code>lv2_get(port, specific_thing_I_want)</code> could work for everything
   (and this ability is already there).  This results in situations like people
   thinking they are blocked by a missing function, and spending a lot of time
   writing and submitting patches to add them, when the functionality was there
   all along.  It would be easier on everyone if everything just always worked
   the same general way, and it would make the API surface <em>much</em> smaller which
   is always nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validation: There has been a data validator for a while, but it wasn't
   great.  It didn't, for example, point at the exact position in the file
   where the error was, you just had to figure that part out.  The new version
   of serd fixes this, so validation errors and warnings use standard GCC
   format to report the exact position along with a helpful error message,
   which automatically integrates with almost every editor or IDE on the planet
   for free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SDK: As mentioned above, I'm working on putting all the "standard" host
   libraries into a unified "lv2kit" which is the one package you will need to
   build LV2 things.  There are still some details about this I haven't sorted
   out (e.g. should the spec be in there or not?  What about non-LV2-specific
   libraries like serd?  Optional vendoring?), but it's coming along and I
   think will make it far more realistic to expect people to implement LV2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spec mess: I am idly thinking about whether or not it would be possible
   to add a compatibility mechanism to allow us to move URIs without breaking
   anything.  It's largely superficial, but cleaning up the specification list
   would really help the optics of the project if nothing else.  90% here is
   trivial (just aggressively map everything forwards), but all the corner
   cases still need to be thought out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all the work in the trenches going on at the moment to improve the state
of LV2.  Though I wish I, or anyone else, had the time and energy to invest
effort into addressing the more ambitious questions around the plugin API
itself, at the moment I am more than tapped out.  Regardless, I think it makes
sense to get the current state of things in a form that is moving forward and
easier to work with, and raise the quality bar as high as possible first.  With
a very high-quality implementation and extensive testing and validation, I'll
feel a lot more confident in addressing some of the more interesting questions
around plugin interfaces, and perhaps someday moving towards an LV3.</p>
<p>On that note, feedback is always welcome.  Most of the obvious criticism are
well-known, but more perspectives are always useful, and silent wheels get no
grease.  Better yet, issues and/or merge requests are even more welcome.  The
bus factor of LV2 isn't <em>quite</em> as bad as it seems from the web, but it would
help to get more activity on the project itself from anyone other than myself.
The standards for API additions and such are pretty high, but there's plenty of
low-hanging fruit to be picked.</p>
