<p>The much-awaited (by me, at least) Jack metadata API has arrived. This
will allow us to easily achieve many new things with minimal/nonexistent
API friction. One of the simplest and most obvious is pretty names for
Jack clients and ports, so I've chosen this as the first thing to tackle
(as part of a drive to get Patchage polished up for a much overdue
release).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there is a chicken &amp; egg scenario
here since nothing is setting this metadata yet. So, I've made Jalv and
Ingen both set pretty names for their ports. In the case of Jalv, the
"pretty name" is the label given in the plugin data (distinct from the
LV2 "symbol" which is restricted and unique).</p>
<p>Firing up Jalv with the Tal Dub III plugin (LV2 port courtesy KXStudio),
we can see the port symbols, which are a bit awkward for end users with
their prefixes and underscores. Conflating strong identifiers with
human-readable labels is a serious design error I learned of the hard
way, but that's a discussion for another time...</p>
<p>Enable "Human Names" in the view menu, or press C-h, and voil√†, we see
the pretty names set in Jack metadata (if present) instead.</p>

<p>The metadata API is very simple to use for ports, though there seems to
be a hole in the API which makes it difficult to get the UUID for your
client to set metadata (I want a simple jack_client_uuid, like
jack_port_uuid, but it seems you have to get a string UUID and parse
it to a jack_uuid_t, clunky enough that I just didn't bother). In any
case, I am happy to see a low-friction mechanism in Jack which apps can
use to share metadata towards making a better user experience.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what sort of information proves useful and
becomes established/standard. For those of us of a mad scientist bent
who live in a nest of patch cables, a CV tag seems like another obvious
simple step, but for everyone, a big step is finally having meaningful
port grouping and channel roles. I have always liked to joke that Jack
(like LADSPA) doesn't <em>really</em> even do stereo, but with metadata, we can
mark up stereo, 5.1, Ambisonics, etc., and other clients will be able to
make sense of the channel assignments without resorting to dirty kludges
based on guessing from names. All without changing the ABI one bit. Good
stuff.</p>
