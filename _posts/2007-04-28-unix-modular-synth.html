<p>I've decided to use my blog to archive random ideas until I figure
something better out (on that note, anyone know of any good <em>RDF based</em>
mind-map software, or something generic that can easily be used as one?)</p>
<p>Until then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">&lt;drobilla&gt; crazy thought of the day: write an LV2 extension for text</span>
<span class="err">stream input/output ports, and you can write a trivial unix cmd line</span>
<span class="err">utility wrapper plugin</span>
<span class="err">&lt;drobilla&gt; anyone want to convert midi to text then run it through</span>
<span class="err">sed and grep and convert back to midi in a modular? :)</span>
<span class="err">&lt;gordonjcp&gt; ahahaha</span>
<span class="err">&lt;gordonjcp&gt; you sick sick man</span>
<span class="err">&lt;drobilla&gt; unix modular, best thing ever</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Ingix? Really wouldn't be that hard. Could even make it parallelize
forkey pipelines, if the LV2 contexts extension is powerful enough. More
on that later...</p>
