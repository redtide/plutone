<p>
    After many years, Carla version 2.0.0 is finally here!
</p>
<p>
    Carla is an audio plugin host, with support for many audio drivers and plugin formats.<br>
    It has some nice features like automation of parameters via MIDI CC (and send output back as MIDI too) and full OSC control.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Version 2.0 took this long because I was never truly happy with its current state, often pushing new features but not fully finishing them.<br>
    So the "solution" was to put everything that is not considered stable yet behind an experimental flag in the settings.<br>
    This way we can have our stable Carla faster, while upcoming features get developed and tagged as experimental during testing.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Preparations for version 2.1 are well under way, a beta for it will be out soon.<br>
    But that is a topic for another day.
</p>

<h3>Changes since 2.0-RC4</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fix missing argument in note-on/off osc example</li>
    <li>Fix word-wrap in add-plugin dialog</li>
    <li>Fix Windows README.txt line endings</li>
    <li>Build windows binaries with -mstackrealign</li>
    <li>Don't show side panel in carla-control</li>
    <li>Show "Label/URI" instead of just "Label"</li>
    <li>Keep application signals alive (so Ctrl+C works even while engine is closed)</li>
    <li>Update copyright year</li>
</ul>

<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p>
    To download Carla binaries or source code, jump on over to the

</p>

<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>
    There is no manual or quick-start guide for Carla yet, apologies for that.<br>
    But there are some videos of presentations I did regarding Carla's features and workflows,
    those should give you an introduction of its features and what you can do with it:<br>
