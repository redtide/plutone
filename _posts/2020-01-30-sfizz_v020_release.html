<ul>
  <li>Added an LV2 plugin version.</li>
  <li>The parser now falls back to case-insensitive search if it doesnâ€™t find the
sample file in its current path (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/pull/28">#28</a>), so that the behavior of SFZ libraries
on case-sensitive filesystems will match Windows and macOS default
case-insensitive filesystems.</li>
  <li>The file now reload automatically on file change,
and you can force a reload if necessary (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/issues/17">#17</a>).</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where memory would be read past the end of the file in memory,
generating artifacts.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where the real-time queue handling background loading
of the voices would fail spuriously.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where in the LV2 plugin
the unknown opcode list was truncated (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/issues/18">#18</a>).</li>
  <li>Added dynamic updates for the current modifiers
(panning, stereo image, volume and amplitude mainly) (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/issues/19">#19</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/pull/28">#28</a>)</li>
  <li>Added timing for callbacks and file loading times.</li>
  <li>Added support for pitch bends (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/issues/6">#6</a>) as well as pitch-bend activation for regions
(<a href="https://sfzformat.com/opcodes/lobend">lobend</a> and <a href="https://sfzformat.com/opcodes/hibend">hibend</a> opcodes).</li>
  <li>The JACK client will warn you instead of crashing
if you do not give it a file to load (<a href="https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz/issues/27">#27</a>).</li>
  <li>Added a windows build process for both the shared library and the LV2.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sfizz</code> now builds on all major platforms.</li>
</ul>
