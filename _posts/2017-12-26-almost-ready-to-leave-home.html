Ardour began its life 18 years ago, in late December 1999. The story
has been told many times in many different places, but the gist of it
is that I wanted a program something like ProTools that would run
on Linux, and none existed. I decided to write one. I had little idea what would be involved, of course. Which was probably for the best, otherwise I would likely not have started.
</p>

<p>
Recently, while clearing out old paperwork from my office, I found
myself reading some old issues (2001-2003) of the generally excellent magazine,
<a href="http://www.soundonsound.com">Sound on Sound</a>.They give a pretty good idea of
the state of DAW technology at that time as well as other stuff like
sampling, sequencing and so forth, which at that time were somewhat
separate from the core functionality being offered by DAWs.
</p>
<p>
It occured to me that Ardour has actually managed to reach the goals I
set out back in 2000. It is a capable DAW capable of doing the vast
majority of the things people were doing with this kind of program
around the start of a new millenium. Not suprisingly, that's still a
substantive part of what people are doing now with DAWs in general
even at the end of 2017.
</p>
<p>
There are some things that we were actually doing long before other
DAWs. Anywhere-to-anywhere routing is something we more or less
pioneered, and has now become common. A truly flexible mixer
architecture (whose flexibility is sometimes its downfall). Support
for different solo models. Even today press releases for new versions
of several proprietary DAWs will regularly mention things that Ardour
has done for more than a decade. Oh well - the point is not to gloat
over this kind of thing, since there are plenty of things that Ardour
<em>doesn't</em> do. The point is to note that the initial goals
have largely been satisfied.
</p>
<p>
In fact, they've been more than satisfied, because Ardour also became
a truly multi-platform project (running on Linux, MacOS (nee OS X) and
Windows. It also gained some level of support for MIDI workflow, not
to mention the video timeline.
</p>
<p>
Ardour has also served as the basis for two or three "commercial"
projects - <a href="http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus.html">Harrison Mixbus</a>, <a href="https://www.waves.com/mixers-racks/tracks-live#presenting-tracks-live">Waves Tracks Live</a> (and the likely
short-lived Radar Session software). We've somehow developed a way to
raise significant (though not substantial) income every month, despite
the program remaining under the GPL license. Nobody needs to pay for
Ardour, but lots and lots of people choose to do so. These are no small
accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
There were other, somewhat meta-goals too. I wanted Ardour to serve as
an example (not a template or a toolbox) for other people to learn how to write a
DAW. I doubted that we'd get everything right, but that at least
compared to the situation in 1999, when there was no open source DAW
suitable for use as a ProTools-like system, Ardour has truly fulfilled
this idea. I suspect that Justin Frankel didn't take a lot of
inspiration from Ardour's source code when he started writing Reaper,
but it was fun having him on our IRC channels for a while as he got
started with that project. Ardour has also attracted the involvement
of nearly 50 skilled developers over the years, a dozen or so of whom
have played major roles in the design and implementation of the
program. A couple have even gone on full time paid jobs working on
audio technology.
</p>
<p>
It wouldn't be completely unreasonable, after 18 years of development
and having reached the level of features that Ardour now has, to
consider it done, at least in some senses. It is true that we have a
huge list of 2000+ bugs that remain open in our bug tracker. Our MIDI
workflow has lots to complain about, and there are some glaring
software design errors that users can see if they insist on trying
some not-that-crazy stuff (e.g. working on MIDI versions of Phillip
Glass pieces).
</p>
<p>
Still - people use it. Somebody starts Ardour up somewhere in the
world at least every 3 minutes or so. Some of our users rave about in
comparison to other DAWs. You can make albums with Ardour. Record live
gigs. Basically do all the things I imagined back in December 1999.
</p>
<p>
But are we done? Absolutely not. In my next post, I'll outline some of
the directions that I personally imagine Ardour going in during 2018
and beyond.
