<p>In the past few years of hammering on my repository while moulding
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/ingen">Ingen</a> into the modular of my
dreams, my poor little generative sequencer
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/machina">Machina</a> was often left to rot.
That's a shame, because it's a fun tool to play with if you're into
generative gadgets and pretty graphs.</p>
<p>So, I spent the weekend working on turning Machina back into a usable
app. It's come a very long way in two days, from a mess that doesn't
even compile to most functionality working pretty well:</p>
<p><a href="/images/machina.png"><img alt="A small Machina machine created by step recording" src="//drobilla.net/images/machina.png"></a></p>
<p>Aside from rewriting a lot of the code, testing, and fixing things that
were broken, I've changed the conceptual model a bit. There is now
always just one start node for a machine. This tends to create more
manageable structures, especially when recording several takes into the
same machine.</p>
<p>Step recording has also been significantly improved. You can build
machines entirely in the UI, but this is pretty tedious. It's much more
effective to record, or step record if you want regular timing and no
delays in-between notes. The above pictured machine was created by step
recording MIDI, though I have tweaked the edge probabilities with the
mouse. You can also import a MIDI file, which is an easy way to get a
big machine to work with.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can find the time to turn this into an LV2 plugin and
release it, but for now it is an unreleased Jack application. Give it a
try if you're feeling adventurous, I would appreciate any feedback.</p>
