<p>A new version, SpectMorph 0.5.1 is available at <a href="http://www.spectmorph.org">www.spectmorph.org</a>. SpectMorph is a VST/LV2/JACK synthesis engine which is based on the idea of analyzing audio samples and combining them using morphing.</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot, there are a few new LFO wave forms available (saw, square and random).</p>
<p>On Windows and macOS, from the beginning there was no need for users to compile anything. You could just download SpectMorph, install it and use it. On Linux, we provide packages for Ubuntu and there are also distribution packages for Arch Linux. But this means that as a user, if you use a different linux distribution, you had to build SpectMorph from source. Which may be too difficult for the average user.</p>
<p>This release improves the situation: there are now Generic 64bit Linux binaries available, which provide the VST/LV2 plugin (statically linked). So these binaries should run on just about any linux. Note that this is a new feature, so please let me know if the generic binaries don’t work for you.</p>
<p>This release also contains a few fixes and the detailed list of changes can be found <a href="http://spectmorph.org/news.php">here.</a></p>
<p>Finally let me recommend two youtube videos (if you haven’t watched these yet):</p>
