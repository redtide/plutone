<p>A new tutorial about <a href="https://sfzformat.com/tutorials/subtractive_synths">subtractive synthesizers</a> was shared by DSmolkenâ€™s
sample instruments experience applied in the <a href="https://github.com/sfzinstruments/karoryfer.caveman-cosmonaut">Caveman Cosmonaut</a> sample library.<br />
Some fixes and additions were made in our opcode database and in software as well,
like the Windows <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a> music tracker by sagamusix.<br />
New contributions was provided by other users like jisaacstone,
and a big contribution from jpcima for the <a href="https://sfzformat.com/opcodes/type#cakewalk-implementation">effects</a> section.<br />
Now we have also a new page for convenience
that lists <a href="https://sfzformat.com/misc/all_opcodes">all opcodes</a> present in our database.</p>
