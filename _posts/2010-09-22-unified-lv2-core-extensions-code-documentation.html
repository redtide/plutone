<p>I've reworked the <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/doc/html/">LV2 documentation</a>
generation system to generate all code documentation for
<a href="http://lv2plug.in">lv2plug.in</a> in a single
<a href="http://doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> run. This means the core and all
extensions' documentation are hyperlinked between each other, and there
are handy global indices of everything.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/doc/html/">http://lv2plug.in/ns/doc/html/</a> for an index.</p>
<p>As before, you can go directly to the URI of any lv2plug.in extension in
your browser for documentation, which links to the code documentation
for that particular extension.</p>
<p>Hopefully this reference proves useful for implementers.</p>
