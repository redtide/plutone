<p>LV2 has been slowly but surely moving towards message-based control to
overcome the limitations of static ports. The required low level
facilities have been available for a while now, but the lack of a
standard way to document message-based parameters and host UI support
has been a sticking point. One particularly pressing need is file
parameters. The current sample example has a stop-gap UI to enable
sample loading, but parameters really should be host controllable and
simple plugins should not need a custom UI to be usable. Today I did
some work towards resolving that situation.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/x42/convoLV2">ConvoLV2</a> running in
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/jalv">Jalv</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="A file chooser in Jalv" src="//drobilla.net/images/jalv_file_chooser.png"></p>
<p>Note this is the built-in UI generated by Jalv and not a custom plugin
UI. Unlike traditional LADSPA style controls, the impulse parameter is
not a port, but is set by sending a message to an event port. The plugin
lists parameters with the new patch:writable property, so the host knows
which controls to display (or which parameters it can automatically
set). Parameters are described as normal RDF properties, so any existing
property can be used, or plugins can define them as needed in their data
files (don't let the "RDF" scare you, the description of a Property is
as simple as LV2 ports). One nice advantage of this over ports is that a
project can describe a parameter once and use it in many plugins,
without having to describe the parameter every time. This really adds up
when you have hundreds of plugins with, say, an identical gain
parameter.</p>
<p>These conventions will be established in the next LV2 release (1.4.0),
and the sampler example will serve as a test case. When host support
becomes established, we can also move towards using messages for numeric
parameters, which will finally allow for dynamic parameters, control
ramps, and so on.</p>
