              <p>
It's been a long time since the last release of Ardour, and there's still no schedule or even vague sense of when the next release might appear. I (Paul) felt
that our users, and particularly our subscribers, deserved some
information about what is and has been going on with development over
the last 8 months. I had promised to do this back in December, and it
is now long overdue.
</p>

<p>
The core developers of Ardour (myself and Robin Gareus, with help from Ben Loftis) have been
involved in some major architectural redesigns of Ardour's internals. We didn't
really plan on this as a distinct goal on its own, but rather these
changes emerged out of the desire/need to add new functionality and
fix fundamental issues with the program. In most cases, these changes don't have any particularly noticeable effect on the GUI (Grid/Snap changes are an exception).
Nevertheless, they lay the ground work for more interesting and more visible changes, as well as new functionality in the future.
</p>
<p>
First, let me mention the long term "big picture" goals that we're
working towards:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improving workflow for all common operations, and many less
    common ones.</li>
  <li>Integrating MIDI and audio as seamlessly as possible, so that
    users rarely need to consider the type of data they are working
    with. We'd like to extend this to automation data too.</li>
  <li>Providing fast pathways to getting groove-centric sessions set
    up, with pattern generators and other related tools.</li>
<li>More use of "flexible" time aka timestretching throughout the editing process, if desired.</li>
  <li>Fixing bugs.</li>
  <li>Reducing complexity and increasing discoverability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So far, we've done substantial work in these areas of Ardour's
architecture: 
</p>
<h3>Cue Monitoring</h3>
<p>
Ardour 5.12 allows you to monitor (listen) to either the input signal
to a track, or the existing material on disk for the track, but not
both. This is generally acceptable when working with audio, because
overdubbing works the way most people expect it to. But when working
with MIDI, it is less than ideal - many users expect to be able to use
a MIDI controller (e.g. a keyboard) and generate new sound from the
synthesizer in a track at the same time as listening to whatever has
already been recorded for that track. Being able to listen to both the
input signal and the existing recorded material is often called "cue
monitoring", and this is now possible in the development code. 
</p>
<h3>"Wet" Recording</h3>
<p>
As part of the changes for cue monitoring, the work involved in
playback from disk and recording disk has been split into two
"processors", which are the basic type of objects you can see in
Ardour's mixer signal flow. Processors you already know include the
gain fader, plugins, sends, inserts etc. Now, recording and playback
are just processors too, which means that they can be reordered in the
signal flow. This allows you to (optionally) record <em>after</em> one
or more plugins, often referred to as a "wet recording" (dry recording
means without any FX). We think that some users will find this side-effect
of splitting up recording and playback to be quite powerful in some
settings.
</p>
<h3>Varispeed</h3>
<p>
Splitting playback and recording into two processors per track led us
to re-examine Ardour's mechanism for varispeed playback. This is used
both by the shuttle control, and also when syncing to an external
positional reference such as LTC or MTC. We decided to move this
functionality into a total different "level" of the program
internally, so that the core of the code no longer has to pay any
attention to it at all. Varispeeding is applied to all data flowing in
and out of the program, totally transparently to the rest of the
program. This redesign makes a few new tricks possible, such as
varispeed recording, and having MIDI synth output pitch-shift alongside
disk-based audio. The quality of the resampling engine has gone up dramatically too, since 
we have switched from simple cubic interpolation to using Fons Adriansen's excellent zita-resample code. 
</p>
<h3>Latency</h3>
<p>
Ardour has had plugin latency compensation dating back to almost the
first release of the program. But that compensation was limited to
tracks (not busses), and didn't cover other cases where latency is
introduced into signal flow. Robin (Dr. Gareus to the rest of us) redesigned almost every aspect of
the core of Ardour's processing code to now provide latency
compensation everywhere. This isn't like some DAWs in which "more
things now work". Latency is now compensated for no matter where it
happens, completely and always. 
</p>
<h3>Transport Control</h3>
<p>
The changes to support full latency compensation revealed some
conceptual and implementation issues with the way transport control
operates inside the code. Looping and starting/stopping become much
more complex when taking latency fully into account. Fixing this has
meant a redesign in which every processor in a track or bus is told
precisely which part of the timeline it is expected to be working on,
among several other deep and difficult changes. 
</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>
There is a lot of work to do on Ardour's MIDI workflow. But before
that can happen, there are several subtle errors that are caused by
the way released versions of Ardour have handled musical time. When
you edit and move a MIDI note forward by a quarter note, that process
would actually involve several conversions back and forth between time
measured in samples and time measured in musical units, and the result
is (often) small errors accumulating that lead to the note beginning
and end being "wrong".
</p>
<p>
Changing this has been a mammoth task. Everything that has a position
and/or a duration within the program - a rather common feature in an
application partly there to place and edit things along a timeline -
has needed to be tweaked to use the correct time units at the right
time.
</p>
<h3>Tempo</h3>
<p>
One of the goals of the work on representing time has been to move
towards more flexible tempo maps, specifically ones that do two
things:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>not regard musical (Bar|Beat|Tick) times as deterministic</li>
  <li>flexibly follow human performance more easily</li>
</ul>
<p>Users should be able to put the musical time 1|1|0 wherever they need<br>
to, and in fact may want to have more than one such time in a given<br>
session. They may also want to adjust where the 12th bar starts, or<br>
any other bar for that matter. There may be rubato sections where<br>
musical time (counting) effectively stops. We want to be able to offer<br>
automated analysis and human editing that can easily conform a tempo<br>
map to a human performance, so that later tempo map driven editing<br>
will fit it precisely.</p>

<p>
This work has been ... is ... challenging.
</p>
<h3>Grid vs. Snap</h3>
<p>
In the released versions of Ardour, we noticed that users are often
confused by the Grid. Sometimes the Grid appears to do nothing, and
sometimes it does something unexpected. Furthermore, it required a lot
of switching between grid modes: if you were snapping to 16th notes,
then you had to switch the grid mode if you wanted to snap to a
marker.
</p>
<p>
The "Grid" has been separated into 2 separate features:  Snap and Grid.
</p>
<p>
When "Snap" is enabled, any mouse operation (like splitting or
dragging a region) will be "resolved" to a snap target, if one is
near.  Snap targets can be any of: the nearest marker, the nearest
region start/end, or the Grid. It is now possible to select multiple
snap targets simultaneously.  So, for example, you can choose to snap
to both Markers and the Grid.
</p>
<p>
All snapping is now "magnetic"; and you can no longer snap to a target
that is off-screen.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is a new "snapped cursor" ( a blue line ) which
indicates where the next mouse action will occur, if it isn’t directly
under the mouse.  This is particularly useful when splitting regions:
the blue line indicates where the split will occur, if a snap is in
effect.  In the prior operation, a split could happen quite far from
the mouse, if a snap target was applied.
</p>
<p>
When a "Grid" is selected, then vertical lines will appear on the
editor canvas, extending down from the timeline ruler at the top of
the editor.  If Snap to Grid is enabled, then these lines will
indicate the possible snap locations for your mouse actions.
</p>
<p>
In the released versions of Ardour, there is no connection between the
zoom level in the editor and the grid.  If the snap grid is set to
Beats, then it may be quite unclear what snap is actually doing.  If
you were zoomed out, then the visual indication of individual beats
might disappear, and yet you were still snapping to them.  If you were
zoomed in too close, then you might snap to a beat that is offscreen
(and therefore invisible)
</p>
<p>
We've reworked this so that the grid always takes the visual zoom
level into account, and the visual grid lines will be generated to
sensibly match your current zoom level.  For example: if you have a
grid set to 16ths, but you are zoomed far out, then lines will only
appear on bar lines.  Inversely, if you've selected "bars" for the
grid, but you zoom in very close, we won't draw the quarter- or
16th-note grid lines, because you didn’t request grid marks at that
level.
</p>
<p>
All of these changes should result in a more consistent, "what you see
is what you get" operation for Grid and Snap.
