<p>A new version of SpectMorph, my audio morphing software, is now available on <a href="http://www.spectmorph.org">www.spectmorph.org</a>. Besides Linux and Windows, it now also runs on  <strong>macOS (&gt;= 10.9)</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the installation under Linux, the required instrument data for SpectMorph no longer needs to be downloaded seperately. Instead, the source tarball and Ubuntu packages include the instrument data (the other platforms already do this by default, too).</p>
<p>We added recordings of Claudia – a female opera singer – as new instrument (“Claudia Ah”, “Claudia Oh”, “Claudia Ih”). A few improvements to the instrument building tools were made along the way. To get good results from Claudia’s recordings, we had to add an algorithm that systematically reduces vibrato automatically.</p>
<p>As always, a few minor problems were fixed, for instance the VST plugin automation now works properly with Cubase. A detailed list of changes is available <a href="http://spectmorph.org/news.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>The video for my presentation at Linux Audio Conf 2018 about how SpectMorph implements morphing <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/lac2018-18-spectmorph_morphing_the_timbre_of_musical_instruments">is now available</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a new piece of music created by Sven and me with SpectMorph has been completed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLapBq_HLvU">Clicking</a>.</p>
