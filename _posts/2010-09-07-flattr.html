<p><a href="https://flattr.com/browse/text/all/1">Flattr</a> is an interesting idea,
so I've decided to try it out. I've added
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/slv2">SLV2</a>,
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/patchage">Patchage</a>, and
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/ingen">Ingen</a> as "Things" (perhaps I
should add a generic "drobilla.net LAD stuff" Thing... or come up with a
name for the meta-project that is my LAD work?). Adding an
<a href="http://lv2plug.in">LV2</a> Thing would be good as well, but it would not
be fair for that money to go to me alone, so I am not sure what to do in
that situation.</p>
<p>Let's get more LAD projects on Flattr so I have things in the community
to donate my initial "means" to :)</p>
<p>In related news, drobilla.net svn and/or LV2 followers have probably
noticed my progress in LADville has been uncharacteristically stagnant
lately... my computing set up sort of fell apart (long story), and I
have no working audio setup (*&amp;%\$ firewire...), so motivation has been
running a bit low. However, this winter, I'm deliberately moving
somewhere infinitely more boring than Toronto so I have nothing to do
but work. Hopefully by next spring, there will be solid releases of all
my software (particularly Ingen), and I can finish all those big fancy
LV2 extensions people have been pining for. Then I can justifiably beg
for people to click those donation buttons, right? ;)</p>
