<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqeg5vkTkH-DYxmOO9FJOHA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ardour</a></h3>

<p>Welcome to the Ardour channel, where we curate and create helpful videos related to the Ardour Digital Audio Workstation, an open source DAW for Linux, macOS...</p>

<p>We decided to support Tobiasz “unfa” Karon in making some new videos, based on some of the work he has done in other contexts (both online and at meetings). unfa’s first video won’t be particularly useful for new or existing users, but if you’re looking for a “promotional video” that describes what Ardour is and what it can do, this may be the right thing to point people at.</p>
<p>In the near-term future, unfa will be back with some tutorial videos, so please consider subscribing to the channel.</p>
<p>Thanks to unfa for this opening video, and we look forward to more. If people have particular areas that they’d like to see covered, mention it in the comments here (or on the YT channel).</p>
