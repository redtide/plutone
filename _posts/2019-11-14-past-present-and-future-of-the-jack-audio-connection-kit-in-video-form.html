<p>A few weeks ago I did a talk/presentation at <a href="https://www.sonoj.org/">Sonoj</a>,
regarding the past, present and future of the JACK.</p>

<p>This talk was live-streamed and recorded, and now Sonoj videos are online,
so you can watch this at <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/sonoj2019-1902-jack-past-present-future">https://media.ccc.de/v/sonoj2019-1902-jack-past-present-future</a>.</p>
