<p>A while ago, I implemented <a href="http://drobilla.net/2013/01/20/ardour-midi-patch-controller-and-note-names/">MIDI patch, controller, and note name
support for
Ardour</a>.</p>
<p>There was one thing missing from that work: labelled controller values.
This is particularly useful for controllers that don't represent a
continuous numeric parameter, but instead have a set of specific values.
For example, the Moog Minitaur supports CC #86 to control the LFO sync
clock division, but it's not obvious how a 0-127 number maps to a clock
division. From the manual, we can learn that 61-67 is "1/4", 68-73 is
"1/8 Dot", and so on.</p>
<p>Translate that information into standard MIDINameDocument format, and a
few hours of hacking later... voila, Ardour displays something sensible
when hovering over an automation point instead of a meaningless number.</p>

<p>If you want to add support for your MIDI device or program, my .midnam
documents for the Moog Minitaur, MF-104M, and MF-108M, included in the
Ardour distribution all contain examples of labelled values. It should
be relatively obvious how to copy and modify these for other devices.</p>
