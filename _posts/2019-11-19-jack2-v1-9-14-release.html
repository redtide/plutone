<p>A new version of JACK2 has just been released.<br>
You can grab the latest release source code at
<a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases">https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases</a>.</p>

<p>The official changelog is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix ARM build</li>
  <li>Fix mixed mode build when meta-data is enabled</li>
  <li>Fix blocking DBus device reservation, so it plays nice with others (like PipeWire)</li>
  <li>Use python3 for the waf build scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>This release is mainly for the mixed mode and DBus device reservation fixes.<br>
A few distributions need those, and since not everyone is happy taking “random” git commits, a proper release is needed.<br>
So there you go - a new release. :)</p>
