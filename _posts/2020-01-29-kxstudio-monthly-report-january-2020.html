<p>
    Hello all, another monthly report about the KXStudio project is here.<br>
</p>
<p>
    A few days ago, <a href="https://kx.studio/News/?action=view&amp;url=carla-21-rc1-is-here">Carla 2.1-RC1 was announced</a>.<br>
    As mentioned in that post, Carla's frontend move to C++ has started, for performance, reliability and debugging reasons.<br>
    It is going to be something that, even though means a lot behind the scenes, visibly nothing will change. (except performance)<br>
    Because of this, do not expect many UI related changes in Carla for the time being.
</p>
<p>
    There were more package updates in the repositories. Those are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>lsp-plugins updated to 1.1.13
    </li>
<li>x42-plugins updated to 20200114
    </li>
<li>distrho-ports updated (added Temper as LV2 and VST plugin)
    </li>
<li>bchoppr added
    </li>
<li>bslizr added
    </li>
<li>bsequencer added
    </li>
<li>bshapr added
    </li>
<li>geonkick added
    </li>
<li>mod-cv-plugins added
    </li>
<li>noise-repellent added
    </li>
<li>regrader added
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    A few of those were made possible thanks to LibraZik project, from which I imported a few.<br>
    I am quite grateful for them, and you should be too! :)
</p>
<p>
    On a more personal side of things, I have started renting an office for work (both for employer and FLOSS stuff).<br>
    Its setup took most of the time on the holidays, and quite a fair bit in January too.<br>
    It is mostly done now, only final touches needed. It certainly helps as a kind of motivation boost, and as a way to keep focus too.
</p>
<p>
    Next month will be slower than usual, as I plan to focus more on "boring" stuff like updating the website and documentation.<br>
    That is all for now.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Since I mentioned it, I leave you with a picture of the office (the working area).<br>
    See you next month!
