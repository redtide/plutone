            <blockquote>
              <p>Some Ardour users and other interested readers may be intrigued to know that almost all of Ardour’s lead developer’s work on the program right now is powered by photovoltaic panels. 540W panel capacity and 510Ah of lead-acid AGM batteries generally provides enough power to keep a 4 core i7-3370US 3.10GHz system running, with occasional use of a Mac Mini. It also runs the fridge, lighting, music and pump systems in the Sprinter van that he and his wife are living in until June 2017. With the exception of the Mac Mini, all other computing equipment is 12V DC native (no power bricks), including the 40W Topping amplifier used to power a pair of Micca monitors.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the solar power available in the UK during the winter (where the van will be located) will be enough to keep things running, so at some point reverting to a cable and mains power seems likely. But for now, all of Paul’s work is powered by the sun. Welcome to the future!</p>
<p><em>(ps. as a footnote, the other systems intimately involved in Ardour development, while connected to the grid, are also powered via contracts that guarantee 100% renewable energy sources.)</em></p>
