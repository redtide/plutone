<p>The first unified <a href="http://lv2plug.in/">LV2</a> release, LV2 1.0.0, is out.</p>
<p>This release merges the previous lv2core package with all the official
extension packages, as well as example plugins, lv2specgen, and
additional data. From a developer point of view, the biggest change is
that all LV2 API headers can be used by simply checking for the single
pkg-config package "lv2" (for compatibility the previous "lv2core"
package is still installed). Implementations are encouraged to abandon
the "copy paste headers" practice and depend on this package instead.</p>
<p>With this release, several new extensions have become stable that
together greatly increase the power of LV2: atom, log, parameters,
patch, port-groups, port-props, resize-port, state, time, worker.</p>
