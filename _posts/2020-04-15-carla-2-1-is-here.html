<p>
    Exactly one year after 2.0, Carla version 2.1 is here!
</p>
<p>
    Carla is an audio plugin host, with support for many audio drivers and plugin formats.<br>
    It has some nice features like automation of parameters via MIDI CC (and send output back as MIDI too) and full OSC control.<br>
</p>
<p>
    This is a small but significant update that builds up on top of what was released in 2.0.<br>
    Please see the
    <a href="https://kx.studio/News/?action=view&amp;url=carla-21-rc1-is-here">
      2.1-RC1 announcement
    </a>
    for details on what is is new in 2.1.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Unlike last time, there are no official plans for version 2.2 just yet, my focus will now be going into the DPF and JACK projects instead.<br>
    The <a href="https://github.com/falkTX/Carla/tree/master" target="_blank">
      master branch of Carla's code repository
    </a>
    is now for 2.1, while the previous 2.0 master got renamed "hotfix-2.0.0".<br>
    No new features will be added to 2.1 series, only bugfixes.<br>
</p>
