<p><a href="http://download.drobilla.net/ganv-1.4.0.tar.bz2">Ganv 1.4.0</a> has been released.  Ganv is an interactive Gtk canvas widget for graph-based interfaces (patchers, modular synthesizers, finite state automata, interactive graphs, etc). For more information, see <a href="http://drobilla.net/software/ganv">http://drobilla.net/software/ganv</a>.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Connection::set_curved()</li>
<li>Add ability to select connections by their handles, either individually or in groups with rect select.</li>
<li>Add ability to select connections directly</li>
<li>Add font size API</li>
<li>Adjust padding and placement to precisely fit text</li>
<li>Begin using library and pkg-config names suitable for parallel installation.  This version of flowcanvas is flowcanvas-1 and is NOT compatible with previous versions</li>
<li>Clean up API and improve documentation.</li>
<li>Clean up API/ABI by hiding private implementations.</li>
<li>Dramatically increase performance by rendering text manually rather than using the truly awful Gnome::Canvas::Text.</li>
<li>Fix lingering handle when deleting connections</li>
<li>Further slight improvements in memory consumption and alignment.</li>
<li>Improve scalability to graphs with many connections (eliminate linear connection searches and redundant connection collections).</li>
<li>Remove use of boost smart pointers.  Adding and removing from containers (e.g. Canvas, Module) is now done automatically.</li>
<li>Size empty ports in font based units so they look right when zoomed</li>
<li>Switch to GPLv3+</li>
<li>Use system theme font size by default</li>
</ul>
