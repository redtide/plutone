<p>Today I implemented better UI generation for LV2 plugin controls in
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/jalv">Jalv</a>, particularly grouping
controls under headings which makes a big difference. Unfortunately few
plugins group their controls currently, but hopefully more host support
will provide the incentive to do so.</p>
<p>Other improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a spinbutton to slider controls for precisely setting values
   numerically</li>
<li>Much more efficient layout to pack more controls on the screen at
   once</li>
<li>Support for named scale points ("ticks") on non-enumeration ports</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the UI generated for
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/amsynth/">Amsynth</a> (after I added the
necessary metadata):</p>
<p><a href="/images/jalv_amsynth.png"><img alt="Generic Jalv UI for Amsynth LV2" src="//drobilla.net/images/jalv_amsynth-112x150.png"></a></p>
<p>Still pretty utilitarian, but much more usable, which is the important
thing. Of course, this plugin is quite large, and has a pretty good
custom UI, but I happened to be polishing up its metadata anyway and the
controls group nicely so I used it as my test case.</p>
<p>Maybe some day this code will get smarter and evolve into a library that
can be used by other Gtk hosts. Better group layout is the obvious "next
level" advancement, a flat linear list of controls is pretty limited.
Unfortunately there's no stock Gtk container which can do text-like
reflow, which would be ideal. Perhaps a simpler scheme based on a
maximum reasonable width for a controller would do, where the table will
expand to have more columns if the window is wide enough for several.</p>
<p>Most of the metadata required to generate a good UI is also useful for
other purposes, for example groups make building a decent menu of many
controls feasible (e.g. to add automation lanes in
<a href="http://ardour.org">Ardour</a>), and some types of host UIs like a <a href="http://drobilla.net/software/ingen">modular
patcher</a> inherently need to generate
their own "UI" of sorts.</p>
<p>Good metadata is not at odds with custom UIs, they each have their uses,
but it is important to remove the burden of custom UIs for simple
plugins with just a few controls that really don't need them. It's a
waste of that most precious of all resources - developer time - to have
to code UIs for a few sliders and toggles. Hopefully better host
generated UIs and support for more advanced controls like <a href="http://drobilla.net/2013/01/10/host-generated-lv2-file-choosers/">file
selectors</a>
free up developers to spend more time making useful plugins and less
time wrestling with GUI toolkits.</p>
<p>It is, after all, all about the sound.</p>
