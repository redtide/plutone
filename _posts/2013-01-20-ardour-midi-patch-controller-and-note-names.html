<p>Ardour has supported displaying MIDI patch names loaded from a
<a href="http://www.midi.org/dtds/midi_xml.php">MIDINameDocument</a> (or "midnam"
file) for a while, though only patches, and even that was pretty flaky.
Since this has become an itch for me and it's time for Ardour MIDI to
reach release quality, I took some time to give it a serious overhaul.
In this case, a picture or two is indeed worth a thousand words:</p>
<p><a href="/images/ardour_midi_note_names.png"><img alt="Human readable MIDI note names in Ardour 3" src="//drobilla.net/images/ardour_midi_note_names-150x119.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/ardour_midi_control_names.png"><img alt="Human readable MIDI controller menu in Ardour" src="//drobilla.net/images/ardour_midi_control_names-150x104.png"></a></p>
<p>The note names are mainly useful for doing percussion. Several of the
bundled midnam files have note names defined, and I have added one for
General MIDI drums, which more or less corresponds to a lot of
instruments, including <a href="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/">Hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>Controller names, to my surprise, were not present in any of the
existing midnam files at all. I wanted to sequence a hardware synth (the
Moog Minitaur) without constantly referring to the manual and trying to
remember which CC is which, so I wrote a new midnam file for the device
and implemented support in Ardour. I am very disappointed to learn that
there is no ability to group controllers, which really is the best way
to do things, so I may embrace and extend (in a completely backwards
compatible way) the format in the future to provide a better interface.</p>
<p>The quality of midnam files scattered around the 'net is atrocious. The
MMA actually hosts a DTD for it, but most files use the wrong DOCTYPE
(usually with a broken link), among other problems. I fixed and cleaned
up all the bundled ones in Ardour, validated them against the DTD, and
left a README in that directory about how to do so. Hopefully this,
along with incentive added by these features, encourages the community
to grow a nice set of quality midnam files.</p>
<p>So, MIDI name support in Ardour is now in pretty good shape. Now we just
need to add the corresponding LV2 support...</p>
