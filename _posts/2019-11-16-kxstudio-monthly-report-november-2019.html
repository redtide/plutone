    Hello everyone, it is time for another monthly report in regards to the KXStudio project.<br>
</p>
<p>
    First, the most important I think, some small repository changes have been made.<br>
    I added a "KXStudio" suffix to the repository names, so you get stuff like "KXStudio Plugins" in your package manager now.<br>
    This was requested by a user, and makes a lot of sense.<br>
    The bad news is that your package manager is likely to complain about the changes, as it thinks it is a sign of trouble.<br>
    That is not the case though, as I am here just informing you of that. :)<br>
    A quick "solution" to this is to simply delete the cached apt list information, so the package manager will not have the previous repository title, like so:<br>
    <code>
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    There were a few new packages added to the repositories.<br>
    First, for the basic infrastructure, we got meson 0.51.2 and premake5. A few projects need this in order to build, so we got to have them first.<br>
    The more exciting ones are added and updated application and plugins, the changes on that are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>drumgizmo updated to 0.8.1
    </li>
<li>fluajho updated to 1.4.1
    </li>
<li>moony updated to 0.30.0, enabled inline display
    </li>
<li>patroneo updated to 1.4.1
    </li>
<li>vico updated to 1.0.1
    </li>
<li>surge added
    </li>
<li>dragonfly-reverb added
    </li>
<li>hybridreverb2 added
    </li>
<li>wolf-shaper added
    </li>
<li>wolf-spectrum added
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Lastly, preparations for the next Carla release are well under way.<br>
    I was able to update and build generic Windows and Linux binaries (with Qt 5.9), and macOS is mostly working but still needs some fixing.<br>
    In the past I used to do a bunch of beta releases until the final one was declared stable.<br>
    I am going against this now, and will directly do a "Release Candidate" where no more new stuff can be added, only bug-fixing.<br>
    The next "Linux Audio release day" is January 15, so that will be the target date.<br>
</p>
<p>
    PS: Many of the new packages were imported from the LibraZik project, for which I am extremely grateful for.<br>
    The surge armhf build fails at this point, to be fixed soon.
