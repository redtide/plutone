<p>I have been working on the control protocol aspect of
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/ingen">Ingen</a>, towards a few goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working GUI communicating with the server via a socket</li>
<li>Decent Python bindings for socket interface</li>
<li>Ingen as an LV2 plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>The Python bindings got fleshed out to support a script for loading
<a href="http://alsamodular.sourceforge.net/">AMS</a> patches into Ingen I have
been working on (very preliminary, but in the repository and installed
as 'ingenams'). The socket interface is now sensibly synchronous, e.g.
you send a command, and recv on the socket to get the response, which
will include a status as well as whatever patch updates happened as a
result of the command. I am happy with this route to language bindings,
it's much more pleasant than a mess of direct bindings (e.g. via swig)
and being protocol controlled has many other advantages. The Python
interface is implemented purely in Python, it should be simple to do the
same in any language that can use sockets.</p>
<p>The Ingen GUI can communicate with the engine via the same protocol, so
you can build patches over the network (e.g. if Ingen is running on a
headless machine as part of an audio rig). It can also run in the same
process and use direct function calls for maximum performance.</p>
<p>The Ingen protocol uses the <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/patch/">LV2 Patch</a>
vocabulary to describe changes. For the socket interface, this is
represented entirely in Turtle. When running as an LV2 plugin, Ingen
uses conceptually the same protocol, except in a binary format using LV2
<a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/atom/">atoms</a>. This is a nice example of the
benefits of having things defined in a good abstract model which can be
encoded in many ways. For example, it would be relatively simple to
implement control via JSON for a browser-based Ingen UI, which seems
like the best way to go for separate control panels, but that's a topic
for another day.</p>
<p>Since Ingen control can be expressed as atoms, it can run as an LV2
plugin with a full patcher UI and communicate only via LV2 ports. The UI
is embeddable, and there is no memory sharing between engine and UI or
hidden communication, everything is host managed. Here is a screenshot
of Ingen running in <a href="http://ardour.org/">Ardour</a> 3. The MIDI in Ardour
is played through an Ingen synth plugin, and the output has been
recorded to the audio track. The patch can be manipulated live while
running in Ardour, except for top level ports.</p>
