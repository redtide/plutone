<p>In 2018, a company I was working for asked me to develop an open source solution for audio watermarking. At that point, we didn’t even find a single open source software that would be close to being usable in production.</p>
<p>As a result, today I am making the source code of “audiowmark” publically available under GNU GPL3 or later. It has many features, it is robust, fast, secure and of course we believe that the watermark is not audible for most users.</p>
<p>More infos, source code and <strong>audio demos</strong> are available on <a href="https://uplex.de/audiowmark/">the audiowmark web page</a>.</p>
