              <p><a href="http://tracker.ardour.org" rel="nofollow noopener">tracker.ardour.org</a> has been upgraded from an ancient version of Mantis to the most current stable release. The website looks very different now, but all existing bug reports and user accounts are still there. We hope to find some way to limit the bug-report spam that has recently turned into a small but annoying time waster, and ultimately to enable single-sign on with the rest of <a href="http://ardour.org" rel="nofollow noopener">ardour.org</a>.</p>
