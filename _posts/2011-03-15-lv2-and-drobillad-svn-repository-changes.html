<p>I have changed the layout of the LV2 repository and my LAD repository to
no longer use externals for build system things (namely autowaf, which
is now bundled in a custom waf script).</p>
<p>SVN does not deal well with anything changing about externals, so I
<em>highly</em> recommend you delete your tree entirely and make a fresh
checkout. If you don't do this, and have problems, I don't want to hear
about them :)</p>
