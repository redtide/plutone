<p>I have been working on <a href="http://drobilla.net/software/suil">Suil</a> support
for wrapping native Windows plugin UIs in Gtk. Here is a plugin with a
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/pugl">Pugl</a> UI embedded in the Gtk version
of <a href="http://drobilla.net/software/jalv">Jalv</a>:</p>

<p>Very fresh work, but the basics (display, and mouse/keyboard input) are
working well. This work is not actually OpenGL specific, any native
Windows UI will work equally well. Apologies for the boring screenshot,
this is just my test GL plugin that does nothing. However, it is a
working example of a plugin with a portable custom UI; hopefully we'll
soon see production plugins with UIs that work equally well across
toolkits and platforms.</p>
