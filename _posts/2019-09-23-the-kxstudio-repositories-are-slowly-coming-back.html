<p>
    Greetings from Portugal.<br>
    After some time setting up in a new country, thinking and planning, I (falkTX) decided a few things in regards to the KXStudio project.<br>
</p>

<p>
    First of all, if you have not noticed, the KXStudio ISO images were taken down.<br>
    They were using Ubuntu 14.04 as base, that while still works in many cases, starts to show its age.<br>
    The fact that I can no longer run it myself (due to a new GPU that is unsupported in its older OS stack) forced me to finally move to something new.<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.5em">
    Wherever new ISOs will come back again is undecided at this point.<br>
    They are not a priority at all right now, so if I get to make them again it is not going to be this year or the beginning of the next.<br>
    I still like KDE/Plasma the best in terms of desktop experience, so that would remain.<br>
    Plasma and KDE ecosystem is changing too fast, it does not make it easy for what I want in KXStudio.<br>
    Perhaps when Qt6 is out, KDE/Plasma5 will slow down a bit, we'll see...<br>
</p>

<p>
    Anyway, the bigger news is that the KXStudio repositories are coming back!<br>
    (for those that do not know, KXStudio has repositories that sit on top of any Debian or Ubuntu system and provides updates and new packages related to audio/music production)<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.5em">
    To be honest, they are already back right now :), but not in a state that matches what they used to be before.<br>
    I am in the process of bringing over all the relevant packages slowly. A few packages per day so in a few weeks we should be good again. :)<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.5em">
    Anyway, a new repository setup was really needed.<br>
    Previously, the repositories were mixing packages built in 3 different Ubuntu versions and there was a separate gcc5 variant of the repos with a few packages that use the new libstdc++ ABI introduced in gcc5.1.<br>
    This was a pain to manage, so better to rethink it.<br>
    I kept things somewhat updated over the years, and did not change/break the repositories in a meaningful way because 14.04 was still supported and what I used daily anyway.<br>
    Now that enough time has passed and 14.04 is officially EOL, perfect chance to rework the repositories for the future!<br>
</p>

<p>
    Here is the current situation:
</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>
    The new repositories require at least Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10 (or equivalent)
    </li>

    <li>
    There is a single deb file to be installed in order to activate the repositories.<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.25em">
    (hopefully no more libstdc++ ABI breakages again, please...?)
    </li>

    <li>
    The old repositories are considered legacy and will no longer be updated.<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.25em">
    Packages included on them will still remain available for some time.
    </li>

    <li>
    You will not be automatically updated to the new repositories, it has to be done manually<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.25em">
    This is to prevent breakage of existing systems, mostly for keeping "old" packages installable.<br>
    Once you update to the new repositories, you will not be able to "apt-get install" packages that were present in the old repositories but are not yet in the new ones.<br>
    This is intentional. There are quite a few packages that I will not be supporting anymore, and thus won't end up in the repos.<br>
    When you move to the new repos, you will be able to remove the KXStudio specific version of packages and then install whatever version someone else provides.<br>
    I will not be uploading packages to the new repositories that I do not intend to keep updated.
    </li>

    <li>
    armhf and arm64 are now supported targets, taking Raspberry Pi 3 as the minimum specs<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.25em">
    With this, the repos will support 32 and 64bit Intel-based architecture, plus 32 and 64bit ARM.
    </li>

    <li>
    Audio plugins (including standalone synths and FX) are the focus of the repos.<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.25em">
    General applications and tools will not be supported anymore.<br>
    This is mainly to reduce the burden of maintaining the repos, as applications often have very complex dependencies compared to plugins (some are actually quite difficult to build).<br>
    I will be packaging a few that I personally use, or that have stalled in feature development.
    </li>

    <li>
    All available application and plugin packages are listed
    <a href="https://kx.studio/Repositories:Applications" target="_blank">here</a>
    and
    <a href="https://kx.studio/Repositories:Plugins" target="_blank">here</a>
    respectively.<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.25em">
    There are direct deb files to download from those pages, for those that want something specific in the repos but do not want to enable the full thing.<br>
    These 2 pages are automatically generated, and fetch their contents directly from the repositories.<br>
    </li>

    <li>
    There is a page dedicated to questions about the repositories
    <a href="https://kx.studio/Repositories:FAQ" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.25em">
    I will be updating this page as more questions appear.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Speaking of updates, the website needs some touches here and there...<br>
    Already started with a few, like removing the home carousel and all use of JavaScript, plus updating the pages related to the repositories obviously. :)<br>
    It is a moving target as pretty much all websites, so don't be surprised to see changes, though they won't be that substantial..
</p>

<p>
    That is all for now, thank you.<br>
</p>

<p>
    PS: You might be wondering why I am writing this text in first person, contrary to other past posts.<br>
    This is mainly because, well, KXStudio was and still is a one-person project (with the occasional help here and there for small things).<br>
    I am making an effort to not write "marketing speech"-like anymore, just that.<br>
