<p>A new version of JACK2 has just been released.<br />
You can grab the latest release source code at
<a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases">https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases</a>.</p>

<p>The official changelog is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meta-data API implementation. (and a few tools updated with support for it)</li>
  <li>Correct GPL licence to LGPL for files needed to build libjack.</li>
  <li>Remove FreeBoB backend (superseded by FFADO).</li>
  <li>define JACK_LIB_EXPORT, useful for internal clients.</li>
  <li>Mark jack_midi_reset_buffer as deprecated.</li>
  <li>Add example systemd unit file</li>
  <li>Signal to systemd when jackd is ready.</li>
  <li>Set “seq” alsa midi driver to maximum resolution possible.</li>
  <li>Fix loading internal clients from another internal client.</li>
  <li>Code cleanup and various fixes. (too many to mention here, see git log for details)</li>
</ul>

<p>This release is focused on meta-data support, and this is why it took so long.<br />
There might be odd cases here and there and a few bugs, as it is often the case
for all software…<br />
So please make sure to report back any issues!</p>

<p>Special thanks goes to Rui Nuno Capela for the initial pull-request regarding
meta-data.<br />
There was some work needed afterwards, but that was the biggest hurdle and
motivation needed for a new release. :)</p>

<p>There are still no updated macOS or Windows builds, those will be handled at
a later date.<br />
Current plan is to have JACK1 feature-parity first
(only a2jmidid and zita internal clients missing now),<br />
and afterwards merging examples/tools and header files to be shared between
JACK1 and JACK2.</p>

<p>The situation regarding development of JACK and JACK1 considered legacy has not
changed since last release 2 years ago.<br />

<p>PS: I will be in Cologne for <a href="https://www.sonoj.org/">Sonoj</a>, giving a talk about
“Past, Present and Future of JACK”.<br />
There is no registration fee, so please feel free to come by and say hello! :)</p>
