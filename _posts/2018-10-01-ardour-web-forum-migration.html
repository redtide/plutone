              <p>12 years ago the Ardour Forum was launched and there have been little to none infrastructure updates since.<br>
12 years of Ardour online community.<br>
12 years of web-evolution!</p>
<p>Brace yourself, because we have opted to perform a long overdue modernization and migrate the forum to <a href="http://discourse.org">discourse.org</a>!</p>
<p>The most significant changes compared the previous forum are: support for dynamic notifications, a flat front-page with context and the page-less layout. Just keep scrolling down.</p>
<p>That barely scratches the surface though. There is plenty to discover and we hope you’ll feel right at home here with us!</p>
<p>However, we will leave you with some nostalgia from time to time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>User-accounts remain</strong> at <a href="https://community.ardour.org">https://community.ardour.org</a>. This includes
<ul>
<li>Sign-on and password management</li>
<li>Download purchases,  donation and subscriptions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All forum posts and comments have been migrated. You can even find the very first post of the then “<a href="https://discourse.ardour.org/t/the-new-ardour-website/78123">The New Ardour Website</a>” from early 2006 here <img src="//discourse.ardour.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>There are certainly some loose-ends to be tied up to complete the migration. If you find some dangling links,  or please don’t hesitate to let us know in the comments. You’re also more than welcome to leave feedback about this site, its organization and how we could improve it in the  <a href="https://discourse.ardour.org/c/site-feedback">Feedback Section</a>.</p>
<p>Let the discourse begin!</p>
