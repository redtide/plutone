<p>
    Hello again everyone, it is release day! <i>(kinda, just a casual 4 days late...)</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    This is the announcement of the first release candidate of Carla 2.1.<br>
    I am skipping the beta phase as done for the 2.0 release and going straight into a Release Candidate.<br>
    This means there will be no more changes in the graphical user interface or engine/backend features, except when required for fixing bugs.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Carla projects/sessions are meant to be fully compatible between between 2.0 and 2.1 versions, except for features marked experimental.<br>
    The "native" API to access carla as plugin (as used by LMMS) is ABI and API-wise backwards compatible compatible with 2.0.<br>
    If this is not the case, consider it a bug that needs to be fixed.
</p>
<p>
    As with the v2.0 release, the list of changes is a little big, so let's split it by parts.<br>
    First, the highlights and major changes, in no particular order of relevance.<br>
</p>

<br>

<h3>Better CV Support</h3>
<p>
    CV ports are now supported in the internal patchbay mode, meaning you do not need to use JACK with Carla in order to use CV plugins.
</p>
<p>
    Automable parameters can now be exposed as a CV port, so they can be controlled by regular CV sources or other plugins.<br>
    This is a kinda feature preview, as there are some limitations at the moment:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Parameter changes are not sample accurate<br>(in a later version, Carla will split buffer up to 32 frames for more fine-grained control changes)</li>
    <li>Not all plugin formats and parameter types are allowed to be controlled this way<br>(to be extended as I test more compatibility)</li>
    <li>Only available for parameter inputs, not outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In order to make CV more useful by default, a new internal "MIDI to CV" plugin was added, originally created by Bram Giesen.<br>
    More plugins will be added as needed, for now I recommend to use
    <a href="https://github.com/blablack/ams-lv2" target="_blank">ams-lv2</a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/moddevices/mod-cv-plugins" target="_blank">mod-cv-plugins</a>
    as they already do a lot.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Also, a new variant of Carla as plugin was created that provides audio, MIDI and 5 CV ports (for each side).<br>
    This allows CV signals to flow in and out of Carla as a plugin.

<h3>High-DPI support (work in progress)</h3>
<p>
    Initial work was done to support high-DPI screens.<br>
    Note that this was not tested very extensively, due to lack of proper hardware, but the requirements in terms of code are all there.<br>
    There are still a few "normal" resolution bitmaps in use, to be replaced in future releases.<br>
    You can click on the screenshot on the left to see Carla rendered at 3x the resolution.<br>
    <br style="line-height:0.75em">
    So for now, the situation is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most of the icons changed to scalable format</li>
    <li>UI will scale with the desktop automatically, as Qt takes care of that for us</li>
    <li>Some bitmaps still remain, to be replaced by vector images in a future release</li>
    <li>Not extensively tested, feedback is welcome</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proper theme and Carla-Control for Windows</h3>
<p>
    The Windows build stack changed from using official Python and PyQt5 packages to msys ones, allowing us to link against them using mingw (Carla does not support MSVC)<br>
    This makes it possible to use the proper "pro" theme like Linux and macOS already did, and also get Carla-Control finally working on Windows.
</p>
<p>
    Previously, the Carla Windows builds were using Qt's "fusion" theme (which the Carla "pro" theme is based on), which looks very similar but misses all of custom tweaks made for Carla.<br>
    This includes, for example, preventing pop-up menus from taking the entire screen or ugly thick lines being drawn where a small one was expected.
</p>
<p>
    A small but important step towards cross-platform feature parity. \o/

<h3>VST2 plugin for macOS and Windows, plus exposed parameters</h3>
<p>
    This is the final item that was missing for cross-platform feature parity.<br>
    We now have Carla as VST2 plugin running on both macOS and Windows!
</p>
<p>
    Embedding of the full GUI on these systems is not possible, so a small "middleware" window is shown as the plugin custom UI.<br>
    Not the best experience, but allows Carla to finally work as VST2.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, 100 parameters are exposed to the host, dynamically used in the order of the plugins loaded.<br>
    So for example, if the first plugin in the rack has 20 parameters, the first 20 parameters of carla-vst will be mapped to that plugin.<br>
    This continues in order for the remaining plugin parameters until we reach 100 of them.
</p>
<p>
    When Carla is loaded as an internal plugin, parameters will be dynamically available too.<br>
    This feature is not available in the LV2 version of Carla though, at least not yet.
</p>
<p>
    Note: Carla plugins are not "notarized" yet, so they will not run under latest macOS 10.15/Catalina where this is a requirement.

<h3>Wine-native bridge, sorta experimental</h3>
<p>
    This is a way to load Linux binaries under Windows applications running with Wine, in case you need that for some reason<br>
    Personally I made it so that I could run the native Carla inside FL Studio, which allows me to use its sequencer but not have to deal with Windows plugins.
</p>
<p>
    This is available in the KXStudio repositories as "carla-vst-wine" package, you need to copy /usr/lib/winvst/Carla* into your Wine VST dll folder to make it work.<br>
    It requires Carla to be installed system-wide, so it cannot work if Carla is downloaded manually.
</p>
<p>
    Building it is kinda tricky, as it requires building a native-windows dll first, and then a few things with winegcc...<br>
    Packager documentation will be added soon to Carla's source code repository, so other Linux distributions can pick it up.<br>
</p>
<p>
    I demoed this feature at Sonoj last year (2019), you can watch it as the 3rd part of <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/sonoj2019-1914-carla-magic" target="_blank">this video</a>.

<h3>Refreshed add-plugin dialog and favorite plugins</h3>
<p>
    The add-plugin dialog had a major overhaul, now looking much better and with more content visible at once.<br>
    Target was to improve the user experience, making clear that there are filters available. (it was not so obvious in previous versions)
</p>
<p>
    The star on the most-left section of the table is to mark a plugin as a favorite, which will add it as a shortcut to the right-click menus on empty rack and patchbay areas.

<td width="50%">
<h3>Single-page and grouped plugin parameters</h3>
<p>
    The dialog for the generic plugin parameter view also had an update.<br>
    All parameters are now placed in the same tab (separated only by input and output types), and grouped when supported by the plugin.<br>
    The options for mapping a parameter to a MIDI CC were taken out and replaced by a button that triggers a menu with the relevant options.
</p>
<p>
    Note that, at the moment, only a few LV2 plugins support parameter groups.<br>
    This is because most hosts do not support this feature, so plugins do not have many incentives to support such a thing.<br>
    And with not a lot of plugins supporting it, hosts also do not care that much. The usual circular dependency deal...<br>
    But since the feature applies quite nicely to Carla, made sense to add it.
</p>
<p>
    The group can be collapsed by clicking on it.
</p>
<p>
    A similar feature will be added to the patchbay in a later release, so we can group audio ports too. :)
</p>

<h3>More UI changes</h3>
<p>
    The rack items will dynamically show as many knobs as possible<br>
    You can now change the "skin" and color of any rack item, making it easy to identify certain plugins<br>
    Added buffer-size, sample-rate and xrun information to the status; clicking on the xrun counter will reset it to zero<br>
</p>

<h5>Canvas changes</h5>
<p>
    Right-clicking on a canvas group will show options for quickly connecting all ports to another group<br>
    Many small tweaks and fixes, plus a few extra actions, as contributed by Nikita Zlobin (to be documented on the user manual)<br>
    Support for Ardour-style inline-displays, marked experimental in this release (sadly cannot be made stable until Carla v3.0)<br>
</p>

<h5>Carla-control and OSC rework</h5>
<p>
    Carla's OSC support has been reworked, now has its own dedicated page in the settings.<br>
    Carla-Control has been extended to support all non-local-dependent features of the main Carla (like patchbay management and transport controls).<br>
    This will be extended even further in future releases.<br>
</p>

<h5>AU and VST3 support is back, by leveraging JUCE</h5>
<p>
    Disabled during a previous 2.0 beta release, support for the JUCE library was removed and replaced by a heavily stripped-down version of it. (while it was still GPlv2 licensed)<br>
    The reasons for that decision still remain relevant, but in order to keep in mind with Carla's goals, I decided to add back JUCE support - but now completely optional.<br>
    It will always be possible to build Carla without JUCE, it is only used for extra hardware and plugin format support.<br>
    In fact, Linux builds by default do not use it, as there is no need for it.
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, the published macOS and Windows Carla builds do use JUCE, which means Carla supports VST3 under macOS and Windows, and AU under macOS.<br>
    As a bonus, it is now possible to show the custom control panel of ASIO devices. :)
</p>
<p>
    Worth noting is that JUCE does not support VST3 under Linux at this point, so neither does Carla even if you build it yourself with JUCE enabled.
</p>

<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>
    Within a bunch of small fixes and new implementations, here are some changes that deserve to be mentioned:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Carla now requires Qt5, can no longer work with Qt4; but can still use LV2 Qt4 UIs with its built-in bridges</li>
    <li>NSM is now supported for JACK applications</li>
    <li>Added a 16 MIDI port mode for JACK applications</li>
    <li>Added "Cancelable actions" during project and plugin bridges load, so they will no longer time-out; instead the user has the option to cancel them at anytime</li>
    <li>Initial support for LV2 parameter API</li>
    <li>Initial support for LV2 file paths, assuming plugin has no custom UI (click on the show-gui button to open a file dialog)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes for developers and packagers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Linking against the JACK library directly is now possible by using `make JACKBRIDGE_DIRECT=true`, which allows for building Carla as an internal client</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes for users</h3>
<p>
    The code for scanning plugins had a little rework, again, making some internal data structures change.<br>
    Because of this, a full rescan of your plugins is needed after the update.<br>
</p>

<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p>
    To download Carla binaries or source code, jump on over to the <a href="https://kx.studio/Downloads" class="external free" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KXStudio downloads section</a>.<br>
    If you're using the KXStudio repositories, you can simply install "carla-git" (plus "carla-lv2" and "carla-vst" if you're so inclined).<br>
    Bug reports and feature requests are welcome! Jump on over to the <a href="https://github.com/falkTX/Carla" class="external free" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Carla's Github project</a> page for those.
</p>

<h3>Future and final notes</h3>
<p>
    I have started a change of the Carla's frontend coding language, from Python to C++ (for performance, reliability and debugging reasons).<br>
    There are a few canvas related things, currently experimental, that can never be made stable or fast due to how Python/PyQt works.<br>
    Also Carla is not scaling very well at the moment, and the addition of CV controlled parameters and inline-displays does not help its case.<br>
    So a move of the entire frontend to C++ makes quite a lot of sense.<br>
    Whenever this is finished a new release will be made.<br>
    But it is going to be something that, even though means a lot behind the scenes, visibly nothing will change. (except performance)<br>
    Because of this, do not expect many UI related changes in Carla for the time being.
</p>
<p>
    A user manual for Carla has been started.<br>
    It proved to be quite helpful for development too, as I had to justify why things are the way they are, and explain how they work too.<br>
    Now that Carla UI should not change too much for a while, it is the right time for such thing.<br>
    I personally dislike writing such things, but understand it can be quite useful.<br>
    The work-in-progress manual is at <a href="https://kx.studio/Documentation:Manual:Carla">https://kx.studio/Documentation:Manual:Carla</a>.<br>
    (Not much to see there at the moment though, give me time)
</p>
<p>
    That's it.<br>
    Please remember that this is a release candidate, and not the final release.<br>
    Some issues are expected, I will do my best to fix all reports that get to me.<br>
    If I don't know about the issues though, I can't fix them. So please report any issues you find, thanks!
