<p>The comfort zone. Whether it is an actual place which we, creatures of habit, attempt to occupy as frequently as possible, or simply a term used to describe the tendency of not playing it too risky or adventurous, we can all admit that we tend to seek for comfort rather than the unpredictable. As attractive and tempting the comfort zone might appear to you in critical times of decision-making, it will also, often times, act as a barrier to significant improvement and durable growth.</p>
