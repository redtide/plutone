<p>I found some time today to make
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/ingen/">Ingen</a>'s support for running as an
LV2 more solid. I have posted about this before, but it now works at RT
appropriate buffer sizes, and several other bugs have been fixed. Here's
the obligatory contrived screenshot:</p>

<p>People are sometimes confused about how Ingen works as an LV2 (I need to
write proper documentation One of These Days): you don't load an "Ingen"
plugin so much (it wouldn't do anything), as you <em>save</em> an Ingen graph
as an LV2 plugin. The idea is that Ingen is a tool for visually building
plugins. Since LV2 does not support dynamically adding ports, it's
easiest to do your building as a Jack app, so the basic work flow is
something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run Ingen as a Jack app: <code>ingen -eg</code>
</li>
<li>Build a graph, adding ports, plugins, etc.</li>
<li>Save the graph to somewhere in your <code>LV2_PATH</code>, e.g. <code>~/.lv2</code> (which
    happens to be the default directory of the save dialog for this
    reason).</li>
<li>Voila, your graph should now show up in any LV2 host (its URI will
    simply be its local filesystem path, unless you explicitly set a
    stable one). You can check with <code>lv2ls</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no export or compilation involved, Ingen's native format is LV2
compatible (graphs are always saved in the same format). If you saved a
graph elsewhere you can simply copy it to <code>~/.lv2</code> to use it as a
plugin, though for now you may have to create or fix the symlink to the
engine binary manually to do this.</p>
<p>Note that you can edit the graph while it's running as an LV2 plugin,
including adding new nodes and connections, you just can't add top-level
ports because the host doesn't know about them. There is still some work
to be done polishing this up to be ready for prime-time, but for the
brave, it's more or less good to go.</p>
