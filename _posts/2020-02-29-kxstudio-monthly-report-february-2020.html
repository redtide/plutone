<p>
    Hello everyone, it is time for another monthly report in regards to the KXStudio project.<br>
</p>
<p>
    First, there were many bugfixes made to Carla, we are very close to RC2.<br>
    I only have 2 things that I want to do before the RC2,
    first being fixing multi-instance under multi-client mode and second is to finalize the last couple of bugfixes.<br>
    So the RC2 should be out in a few days, maximum weeks.
</p>
<p>
    Second, something that came out of (re-)packaging WineASIO
    (and moving away from Cadence, but that is a story for another day...).<br>
    I am taking over as maintainer of the WineASIO project.<br>
</p>
<p>
    WineASIO is something that is mostly "done", there is not much that we can add to it.<br>
    Since I have to keep it building in order to package it, I spoke with upstream and let them know I was available to take over.<br>
    (maintaince work is pretty minimal, just got to make it build basically)
</p>
<p>
    We are trying to take over
    <a href="https://github.com/WineASIO" target="_blank">github.com/WineASIO</a>
    organization, so we can place the source code repository in there.<br>
    If that takes too long, the repository will just end up at
    <a href="https://github.com/falkTX/WineASIO" target="_blank">github.com/falkTX/WineASIO</a>
    as it is for the moment.<br>
    In any case, we will see v1.0.0 release of WineASIO quite soon!
</p>
<p>
    The KXStudio repositories' armhf build of surge has been fixed.<br>
    I have opened a
    <a href="https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/1606" target="_blank">pull request on upstream surge</a>
    to discuss the armhf/arm64 needed changes (basically a SSE2 to NEON conversion).<br>
    They are quite open to it, which is nice to see.<br>
    We just need to fix some minor things now and that could likely be part of 1.7.0 release later on.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, these are the package updates made in the repositories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>carla-git updated
    </li>
<li>mod-cv-plugins updated to latest git
    </li>
<li>sequencer64 updated to latest git, midi_control branch
    </li>
<li>surge updated to 1.6.6
    </li>
<li>cv-lfo-blender-lv2 added
    </li>
<li>g2reverb added
    </li>
<li>invada-studio-plugins (LADSPA) and invada-studio-plugins-lv2 added
    </li>
<li>setbfree added, including VST2 version through lv2vst
    </li>
<li>wineasio added
    </li>
<li>zlfo added
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    That is all for now. Have a great weekend everyone! :)
