<p>A new utility has been added to
<a href="http://drobilla.net/software/lilv">Lilv</a> for benchmarking LV2 plugins.
As you might expect, it is called <code>lv2bench</code>.</p>
<p>Simple, but useful, <code>lv2bench</code> runs all discovered plugins for a
specified number of frames split into a specified block size, and
records the time each plugin took to execute. It prints a simple table
like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Block</th>
<th>Samples</th>
<th>Time</th>
<th>Plugin</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>512</td>
<td>524288</td>
<td>0.005872</td>
<td>http://calf.sourceforge.net/plugins/Filter</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>512</td>
<td>524288</td>
<td>0.006461</td>

</tr>

<p>This makes it easy to get a good overall feel for how expensive plugins
on the system are relative to each other. Of course, a more expressive
view of this information with several parameters would be useful...
<a href="http://gareus.org/">Robin Gareus</a> to the rescue! Robin made a script
currently called <a href="http://robin.linuxaudio.org/lilvplot.sh">lilvplot</a>
which does several runs with various parameters and plots the data,
which makes the relative performance more clear and shows the variance
of a plugin's run time with error bars. This is important information
because run-time variance is a good indicator of how real-time
appropriate a plugin is.</p>
<p>Here is an example of lilvplot output generated from lv2bench data (as a
massive SVG, you may want to open this image in a separate window and
zoom in to see the plugin labels):

<p>Both of these tools are very fresh and there are certainly improvements
to be made (normalizing the y-axis so it showed where real-time is would
be more informative, and lv2bench currently supports very few features),
but they already make a useful addition to the LV2 developer's toolkit.
I found them useful for evaluating the improvements had by vectorizing
the arithmetic plugins in my soon-to-be-released port of
<a href="http://blop.sourceforge.net/">blop</a>. It will be interesting to see how
things stack up in more thorough runs that include more plugins.</p>
