<p>
    Hello all, another monthly report about the KXStudio project is here.<br>
</p>
<p>
    There is not a whole lot of new exciting stuff this time around, as most of the time was spent on Carla new features and bug-fixing.<br>
    I am doing a push towards CV support in Carla (a "MIDI to CV" internal plugin was added, for example),<br>
    with only 1 new feature to be implemented - allowing to automate any regular parameter with CV.<br>
    The idea is to make it easier to automate things in Carla, by exposing individual parameters in the patchbay as CV ports.<br>
    There is only 1 month left for the planned release, so going to be tight on time, but still seems doable, specially with holidays coming.<br>
    (so more free time to work on this)
</p>
<p>
    There were a few minor package updates in the repositories. Those are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>x42-plugins updated to 20191215
    </li>
<li>zam-plugins updated to 3.12
    </li>
<li>sequencer64 added (Qt5 build from git master)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    A new small extra repository has been created, one I have been using for some time now.<br>
    This came out of the necessity to update JACK2, but JACK not being something we can distribute in generic packages like KXStudio does for applications and plugins.<br>
    A few pieces of software, like JACK2 and other libraries, cannot be made into generic deb packages.<br>
    So, I want to create a few small but nice repositories for basic utilities and nice-to-have things.<br>
    For now, I have created a first, small one for Ubuntu 18.04 users (which includes me, obviously :P) which contains an updated JACK2, Wine-RT, among other small things.<br>
    You can find more details about this repository and all future ones coming soon at
      <a href="https://kx.studio/Repositories:Extras">https://kx.studio/Repositories:Extras</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In some news regarding the JACK2 project, it
      <a href="https://jackaudio.org/news/" target="_blank">has its own news page</a>
    now, so I won't be posting JACK2 related stuff here anymore.<br>
    The latest about it, which is worth mentioning, is that its mailing list is back online once again! \o/
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/falkTX/Cadence/releases/tag/v0.9.1" target="_blank">Cadence v0.9.1</a> was released, just tagging it in its git repo so distributions can pick it up.<br>
    It was mostly needed due to an incompatibility with Python 3.8.
</p>
<p>
    And finally, donations for the KXStudio project (basically myself) are open once again, now even with a Patreon page.<br>
    In the past I mentioned that, due to legal costs, it was not worth having them while in Germany and I would open them again once I moved.<br>
    That happened a few months ago, but I dislike dealing with these things, so it took some time...<br>
    They are open once again now, though I removed the PayPal subscription option and counter for now.<br>
    (I am intentionally not posting the link here, I trust that if you care enough, you know where to find it)
</p>
<p>
    Next month hopefully a new Carla release will be here.<br>
    Catia will be made into a standalone project, leaving Cadence behind. But that is news for another time... :)
