<p>Well, I've been working on Ardour but not directly on my SoC project..
finally got around to fixing that whole mixer-strip-element thing that's
been on the table since last year. Things are more open to extensibility
now (and a unified bus implementation should appear soon, so we'll have
MIDI busses or even MIDI/audio (instrument) busses). Maybe we'll see
things like <a href="http://ardour.org/node/1043">this</a> actually happen some
time soonish...</p>
<p>It would be nice to figure out a really good MIDI meter (something more
clever than just an audio peak meter abused), and a MIDI fader that can
work in various ways, or even instrument plugin support, but it's
probably time to get on the actual piano roll editing part of the
project and leave that stuff until afterwards.</p>
<p>Kinda ruins my <em>flow</em> though, you know?</p>
