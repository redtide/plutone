<p>A few days ago a new version of JACK2 was released.<br />
You can grab the latest release source code at
<a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases">https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases</a>.<br />
The official changelog is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix Windows build issues</li>
  <li>Fix build with gcc 7</li>
  <li>Show hint when DBus device reservation fails</li>
  <li>Add support for internal session files</li>
</ul>

<p>If you did not know already, I am now maintaining JACK2 (and also JACK1).<br />
So this latest release was brought to you by yours truly. ;)</p>

<p>The release was actually already tagged on the git repo quite some time ago,
but I was waiting to see if Windows builds were possible.<br />
I got side-tracked with other things and 1.9.12 ended up not being released for
some time, until someone reminded me of it again… :)<br />
There are still no updated macOS or Windows builds, but I did not want to delay
the release further because of it.<br />
The 1.9.11 release (without RC label) was skipped to avoid confusion with the
versions.<br />
So 1.9.12 is the latest release as of today. macOS and Windows binaries still
use an older 1.9.11 version.</p>

<p>Being the maintainer of both JACK1 and JACK2 means I can (more or less)
decide the future of JACK.<br />
I believe a lot of people are interested to know the current plan.<br /></p>

<p>First, JACK1 is in bug-fix mode only.<br />
I want to keep it as the go-to reference implementation of JACK,
but not add any new features to it.<br />
The reason for this is to try to get JACK1 and JACK2
to share as much code as possible.<br />
Currently JACK2 includes its own copy of JACK headers, examples and utilities,
while JACK1 uses sub-repositories.<br />
During the course of next year (that is, 2018) I want to get JACK2 to slowly use
the same stuff JACK1 does, then switch to use the same repositories
as submodules like JACK1 does.<br />
This will reduce the differences between the 2 implementations, and make it
a lot easier to contribute to the examples and utilities provided by JACK.<br />
(Not to mention the confusion caused by having utilities that work in simlar yet
different ways)<br />
We will keep JACK1 “frozen” until this is all done.<br /></p>

<p>Second, but not least important, is to get the JACK1 specific features into JACK2.<br />
A few things were added into JACK1 after JACk2 was created,
that never made it into JACK2.<br />
This includes meta-data (JACK2 does have the API, but a non-functional one)
and the new internal clients.<br />
The purpose is to reduce reasons users might have to switch/decide between
JACK1 and JACK2.<br />
JACK2 should have all features that JACK1 has, so that most users choose JACK2.</p>

<p>Now, you are probably getting the impression that the focus will be on JACK2,
which is correct.<br />
Though I realize some developers might prefer JACK1’s design, the long “battle”
of JACK1 and JACK2 needs to stop.<br />
Development of new features will happen in the JACK2 codebase,
and JACK1 will slowly become legacy.<br />
Well, this is my personal plan at least.<br /></p>

<p>Not sure if this all can be done in 2018, but better to take things slowly
and get things done than do nothing at all.<br />
I will keep you updated on the progress through-out the year.<br />
Happy holidays everyone!</p>
